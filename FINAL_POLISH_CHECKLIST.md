# Final Polish Checklist for "After Cognition"

## üéØ Core Message
Your thesis successfully argues that human value will concentrate in irreducible domains (Presence, Cohesion, Meaning) as AI capabilities expand. The work is strong, timely, and nearly ready.

## ‚úÖ Major Strengths (Keep These!)
- [x] Paramedic opening metaphor - powerful and immediate
- [x] Stratified reality analysis (Part I, Section 1.4) - crucial equity focus
- [x] Three domains framework - clear and phenomenologically grounded
- [x] UK MOJ integration - transforms thesis from theoretical to validated
- [x] Monitor vs. Treater distinction - immediately practical
- [x] Developmental caregiving synthesis - universally relatable
- [x] Balance of theory and practice throughout

## üîß High-Priority Revisions (Do These)
- [x] Replace grey literature citations (especially COGSware) with peer-reviewed sources
- [x] Make 5-10 year timeframe explicit in each part's introduction
- [x] Add paragraph acknowledging LVDC measurement paradox in Part III
- [x] Smooth transition between Parts I and II (philosophical pivot needs cushioning)
- [x] Add 2-3 more concrete institutional examples beyond UK MOJ

## üìù Medium-Priority Improvements
- [ ] Reduce repetition of three domains explanation (keep best version in Part II)
- [ ] Tighten Part IV cartographic methodology (more concrete, less abstract)
- [ ] Ensure "correlates vs. constituents" section doesn't disrupt flow

## üí° Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add brief glossary of key terms
- [ ] Update any 2024 citations to most recent versions
- [ ] Consider adding one more non-Western philosophical tradition
- [ ] Add transition sentences between major sections

## üöÄ Ready to Launch
With these minor revisions, your thesis is ready to defend. The Value Concentration Hypothesis is compelling, the evidence is strong, and the practical implications are clear. You've successfully created a work that is both philosophically sophisticated and practically applicable - a rare achievement.

## üìä Overall Grade: A- ‚Üí A (with revisions)

The thesis makes a significant contribution to philosophy, AI ethics, and policy. The integration of UK MOJ evidence was a game-changer. Your attention to equity and differential impacts sets this apart from typical AI philosophy. Well done!
