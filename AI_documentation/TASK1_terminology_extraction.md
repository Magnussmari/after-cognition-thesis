# Comprehensive Terminology Extraction: After Cognition
*Generated: August 13, 2025*

## 1. Core Theoretical Concepts

### Value Concentration Hypothesis
**Definition**: The central thesis that as artificial intelligence commoditizes cognitive labor, human value does not disappear but concentrates in architecturally irreducible domains. This concentration follows predictable patterns that individuals and institutions can leverage.

**Key characteristics**:
- Value migrates rather than vanishes
- Concentration occurs in domains AI cannot access architecturally
- Creates new economic dynamics and premiums
- Follows predictable patterns

**Context**: Introduced in the Introduction and developed throughout the thesis as the fundamental economic insight.

### Commoditization Crisis
**Definition**: The systematic conversion of human capacities into fungible, priceable units through AI automation, leaving humans rich in output but impoverished in being. This is distinct from commodification (transformation of non-market relations into market goods).

**Key characteristics**:
- Affects cognitive labor specifically
- Creates existential disorientation
- Stratified impact (highest on Hispanic workers at 25.5%, Black workers at 23.1%)
- Manifests in rising anxiety, political polarization, and "existential vertigo"

**Distinction from Commodification**:
- **Commoditization**: Market process where differentiated goods become undifferentiated (what AI does to cognitive tasks)
- **Commodification**: Transformation of non-market relations into market goods (broader social process)

**Context**: Part I provides the diagnosis and empirical evidence of this crisis.

### Ástrós Paradox
**Definition**: Named after the author's wife, this paradox describes the methodological approach of using AI systems to map their own limitations, like using an MRI to reveal what bones cannot show.

**Key characteristics**:
- Paradoxical methodology
- AI reveals precisely what it cannot capture
- Named after a person whose irreducible presence catalyzed the work
- Transforms AI from threat to diagnostic tool

**Context**: Introduced in the Prologue and operationalized in Part IV.

### Cultivation Economy
**Definition**: A systematic reorientation of economic and social systems around developing rather than extracting irreducible human capacities.

**Key characteristics**:
- Invests in human development rather than extraction
- Values depth over scalability
- Positions humans as complements to AI, not competitors
- Creates new economic models and institutional structures

**Components**:
- Navigation tools (LVDC)
- Implementation strategies
- Political pathway (three-tier transformation)

**Context**: Developed in Part III as the practical response to the commoditization crisis.

### Irreducibility/Irreducible
**Definition**: Referring to human capacities that are architecturally unavailable to computational systems due to fundamental constraints, not temporary technical limitations.

**Key characteristics**:
- Not about complexity but architectural constraints
- Grounded in embodiment, mortality, and genuine stakes
- Cannot be simulated even with infinite resources

**Context**: The concept underpins the entire thesis framework.

### Life-Value Development Compass (LVDC)
**Definition**: A proposed theoretical framework and instrument for navigating growth in irreducible domains, serving as a compass rather than a ranking system.

**Components**:
- Presence subscale
- Cohesion subscale
- Meaning subscale

**Purpose**: Navigation tool for cultivation, not classification

**Context**: Detailed in Part III as a practical framework for implementation.

### COGSware
**Definition**: A term capturing the shift in AI economics where, unlike traditional SaaS with fixed infrastructure costs, AI applications face variable compute costs that scale with usage.

**Characteristics**:
- Variable compute costs
- 50-70% margins vs 80-90% for traditional SaaS
- Per token/query pricing
- Linear scaling costs

**Context**: Part I, illustrating the economic dynamics of AI deployment.

### The Modern Midas Paradox
**Definition**: The contemporary parallel to King Midas's curse, where AI as the new golden touch transforms diverse human qualities into fungible cognitive output, creating wealth while destroying what makes life meaningful.

**Context**: Opening metaphor in the Introduction.

### Lebenswelt (Lifeworld)
**Definition**: From Husserl, the pre-theoretical lived world—the ground of all experience that computation cannot access because it manipulates representations, not reality itself.

**Context**: Part II's phenomenological foundation.

### Three Domains (Triadic Structure)
**Definition**: The three territories where human value remains irreducible: Presence, Cohesion, and Meaning. These form an interconnected whole rather than separate capacities.

**Context**: Central organizing structure of Part II.

### Monitor vs. Treater Distinction
**Definition**: The fundamental pattern where AI excels as a monitor (tracking, analyzing, providing information) but fails as a treater (providing genuine care, presence, transformation).

**Context**: Part IV, illustrated through therapy and caregiving examples.

### Authenticity Premium
**Definition**: The economic premium that attaches to genuinely human-created goods and services, not for superior output but for the meaning imbued by human creation.

**Context**: Part III's economic modeling.

### Zero-Marginal Cognition
**Definition**: The economic reality where AI drives the marginal cost of cognitive tasks toward zero after training costs are amortized.

**Context**: Part I's economic analysis.

### General-Purpose Technology (GPT)
**Definition**: A technology that improves rapidly, diffuses pervasively, and catalyzes complementary innovations. AI is identified as the latest GPT.

**Context**: Part I's framework for understanding AI's economic impact.

### Stratified Reality
**Definition**: The unequal distribution of the commoditization crisis's impacts across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.

**Context**: Section 1.4, providing crucial context for inclusive solutions.

## 2. The Three Irreducible Domains - Detailed Analysis

### Domain I: Presence (The Embodied Self)
**Definition**: The irreducible value of embodied consciousness—what computation cannot access because it lacks mortal flesh.

**Key Components**:

**Why Irreducible**: Requires mortal embodiment, lived experience, first-person consciousness

### Domain II: Cohesion (The Intersubjective We)
**Definition**: The irreducible value of trust born from mutual vulnerability—what AI cannot achieve because it has nothing to lose.

**Key Components**:
- **Trust Beyond Transaction**: Genuine trust requiring possibility of betrayal

**Why Irreducible**: Requires genuine vulnerability, mutual risk, shared mortality

### Domain III: Meaning (The Narrative Arc)
**Definition**: The irreducible value of self-authored narrative—what emerges only from a life actually lived, not simulated.

**Key Components**:
- **Narrative Identity**: Life stories that create meaning from events
- **Integration of Suffering**: Transforming trauma into wisdom
- **Self-Authorship**: Genuine temporal existence creating coherent story
- **Awe Capacity**: Self-transcendent experience that reorders values
- **Post-Traumatic Growth**: The uniquely human alchemy of meaning from pain
