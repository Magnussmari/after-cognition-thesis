## Overview

This document outlines the systematic, tiered approach used for managing citations and references in the AI-Governance thesis. The methodology was developed to ensure academic rigor while leveraging both traditional scholarly practices and modern AI-assisted tools.

## Three-Tier Citation System

### Tier 1: Foundational Sources üèõÔ∏è
**Definition:** Core theoretical frameworks, seminal works, and sources that anchor the fundamental arguments and affect the entire arc of the thesis.

**Verification Process:**
- Meticulously fact-checked against original publications
- Manual verification of all quotes and page numbers
- Cross-referenced with multiple editions when applicable
- Direct consultation of primary sources where possible
- Full PDF copies obtained and archived

**Examples:**
- Classical philosophical texts (Durkheim, Levinas, Merleau-Ponty)
- Foundational AI ethics papers
- Key regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, etc.)
- Seminal works on trust and social theory

**Quality Assurance:** 100% manual verification, zero tolerance for errors

### Tier 2: Supporting Evidence Sources üìä
**Definition:** Sources providing specific empirical claims, statistics, events, case studies, and data supporting particular arguments.

**Verification Process:**
- All empirical evidence fact-checked against original sources
- Statistics verified for accuracy and context
- Dates and events cross-referenced with multiple sources
- Methodology sections reviewed for cited studies
- PDF copies obtained for all journal articles

**Examples:**
- Industry reports (McKinsey, Edelman Trust Barometer)
- Academic studies with specific findings
- Government statistics and reports
- News articles documenting specific events
- Technical documentation

**Quality Assurance:** Empirical accuracy verified, contextual integrity maintained

### Tier 3: Exploratory and Contextual Sources üîç
**Definition:** Background reading, exploratory sources, and contextual materials that informed thinking but may not directly appear in final arguments.

**Verification Process:**
**During Initial Writing Phase:**
- Allowed to "wait" in provisional state
- Basic bibliographic information captured
- Tagged for later verification

**Post-Manuscript Completion:**
- Every bibliography entry verified for accuracy
- All sources confirmed as accessible
- PDF copies sourced and archived where available
- Metadata corrected using automated tools
- Dead links identified and alternatives found

**Quality Assurance:** Full verification before submission, triple-checking protocol

## Verification Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Collection
- Sources collected in Zotero during research phase
- Basic metadata captured automatically where possible
- Sources categorized by tier upon entry

### Phase 2: Writing Phase
- Tier 1 sources verified before use
- Tier 2 sources checked when citing specific claims
- Tier 3 sources accumulated for later processing

### Phase 3: Post-Writing Verification
- Systematic review of all citations
- Zotero library cleaned using Zotadata plugin
- Metadata verification via multiple APIs:
  - CrossRef for DOIs
  - DBLP for conference papers
  - OpenAlex for academic metadata
  - Semantic Scholar for citation networks

### Phase 4: Pre-Submission Triple-Check
1. **First Check:** Automated metadata validation
2. **Second Check:** Manual review of all citations in text
3. **Third Check:** Final proof against PDF sources

## AI-Assisted Tools Used

### Zotero Integration
- **Zotero MCP:** Local API integration for library management
- **Zotadata Plugin:** Automated metadata correction and PDF retrieval
- **API Sources:** CrossRef, DBLP, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, Google Books

### Verification Tools
- DOI verification through CrossRef
- Automated PDF retrieval from:
  - Unpaywall (open access)
  - arXiv (preprints)
  - Institutional repositories
  - Publisher websites

### AI Assistance
- GPT-4/GPT-5 used for:
  - Identifying potential citation issues
  - Suggesting metadata corrections
  - Cross-referencing claims with sources
  - NOT used for generating citations or fabricating references

## Quality Control Measures

### Red Flags Identified and Addressed
- Future-dated publications (2025 entries corrected)
- Missing DOIs for journal articles
- Incomplete author information
- Orphaned PDF attachments
- Incorrect publication types (preprints vs. published)

### Archive Protocol
- All Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources archived as PDFs
- Local backup of entire Zotero library
- Version control for bibliography changes
- Documentation of any source substitutions

## Ethical Considerations

### Transparency
- Full documentation of AI tool usage
- Clear attribution of all sources
- No fabricated or hallucinated references
- Acknowledgment of verification methods in thesis methodology

### Academic Integrity
- Original sources consulted wherever possible
- No reliance on AI-generated summaries for citations
- Manual verification of all critical claims
- Preservation of author intent and context

## Lessons Learned

### Effective Practices
1. Tiered system prevents overwhelming verification workload
2. Early categorization saves time in final stages
3. Automated tools excellent for finding missing metadata
4. Manual checking essential for foundational sources

### Challenges Addressed
1. AI tools can hallucinate references - never trust without verification
2. Conference papers often have incorrect metadata
3. News articles require special attention to dates
4. Preprint vs. published version confusion common

## Final Notes

This methodology represents a hybrid approach combining traditional scholarly rigor with modern technological assistance. The tiered system ensures that effort is proportionally allocated based on the importance and function of each source within the thesis structure.

The key principle maintained throughout: **AI tools augment but never replace human judgment in citation management.**
