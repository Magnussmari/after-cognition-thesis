# After Cognition: Complete Terminology Guide

*A comprehensive reference for all concepts, terms, and definitions in "After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility"*

---

## Core Theoretical Concepts

### Primary Framework

#### **Value Concentration Hypothesis**
- **Definition**: The central thesis that as artificial intelligence commoditizes cognitive labor, human value does not disappear but concentrates in architecturally irreducible domains. This concentration follows predictable patterns that individuals and institutions can leverage.
- **Context**: Introduced in the Introduction and developed throughout as the fundamental economic insight
- **Implications**: Reframes AI disruption from replacement anxiety to development opportunity
- **Applications**: Guides individual career choices, organizational strategy, and policy frameworks

#### **Commoditization Crisis**
- **Definition**: The systematic conversion of human capacities into fungible, priceable units through AI automation, leaving humans rich in output but impoverished in being
- **Distinction from Commodification**: 
  - Commoditization: Market process where differentiated goods become undifferentiated (what AI does to cognitive tasks)
  - Commodification: Transformation of non-market relations into market goods (broader social process)
- **Examples**: Knowledge work becoming interchangeable, creative output losing human premium
- **Implications**: Creates existential disorientation, "existential vertigo," and stratified impacts

#### **Ástrós Paradox**
- **Methodological Innovation**: Using AI systems to map their own limitations - "like using an MRI to reveal what bones cannot show"
- **Applications**: Research methodology throughout the thesis, particularly in Part IV
- **Significance**: Transforms AI from threat to diagnostic tool for understanding human irreducibility
- **Named After**: The author's wife, whose irreducible presence catalyzed the work

#### **Cultivation Economy**
- **Vision**: A systematic reorientation of economic and social systems around developing rather than extracting irreducible human capacities
- **Implementation**: Navigation tools (LVDC), workplace protocols, educational reforms, policy frameworks
- **Contrast to Current Systems**: 
  - From extraction to development
  - From scalability to depth
  - From replacement to augmentation
- **Components**: Three-tier political strategy, hybrid economic models, cultivation protocols

### The Three Irreducible Domains

#### **Presence (The Embodied Self)**
- **Definition**: The irreducible value of embodied consciousness—what computation cannot access because it lacks mortal flesh
- **Characteristics**:
  - Grounded in mortality and finite existence
  - Emerges from first-person subjective experience
  - Includes proprioceptive and interoceptive awareness
  - Shaped by "being-toward-death" (Heidegger)
- **Empirical Indicators**:
  - Interoceptive accuracy (MAIA scale)
  - Sustained attention measures (MAAS/FFMQ)
  - Proprioceptive accuracy tests
  - Mortality integration behaviors
- **Examples**:
  - Nurse sensing fever break before monitors
  - Mechanic diagnosing engine by vibration
  - Parent's embodied protective reflexes
  - Flow states in physical activity

#### **Cohesion (The Intersubjective We)**
- **Definition**: The irreducible value of trust born from mutual vulnerability—what AI cannot achieve because it has nothing to lose
- **Characteristics**:
  - Requires genuine stakes and possibility of betrayal
  - Emerges through shared vulnerability
  - Creates bonds beyond transactional reliability
  - Involves reciprocal moral development
- **Empirical Indicators**:
  - Trust scale changes over time
  - Rupture-repair latency in relationships
  - Reciprocity index measurements
  - Group cohesion patterns
- **Examples**:
  - Sweat lodge collective transformation
  - Choir achieving transcendent unity
  - "Smoke break" workplace bonding
  - Conflict resolution creating deeper connection

#### **Meaning (The Narrative Arc)**
- **Definition**: The irreducible value of self-authored narrative—what emerges only from a life actually lived, not simulated
- **Characteristics**:
  - Requires genuine temporal existence
  - Integrates suffering into wisdom
  - Creates coherent identity across time
  - Transforms experience into purpose
- **Empirical Indicators**:
  - McAdams Life Story Interview coding
  - Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)
  - Purpose alignment measures
  - Narrative coherence assessment
- **Examples**:
  - Immigrant reframing displacement as resilience
  - Worker transforming injury into safety advocacy
  - Parent finding meaning through children's opportunities
  - Artist integrating loss into creative expression
