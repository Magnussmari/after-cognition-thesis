# After Cognition Analysis Progress

## Phase 1: Discovery (COMPLETED)
Date: 2025-08-13
Files Analyzed: 12 .qmd files in parts/ directory

### Thesis Overview
- **Title**: After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility
- **Type**: Master's thesis (not PhD as initially stated in prompt)
- **Author**: Magnús Smári Smárason
- **Supervisors**: Professor Giorgio Baruchello, Dr. Christopher DiCarlo
- **Core Thesis**: As AI commoditizes cognitive labor, human value concentrates in architecturally irreducible domains

### Key Findings from Discovery
1. **Central Hypothesis**: The Value Concentration Hypothesis - human value migrates to domains AI cannot access
2. **Three Irreducible Domains**: 
   - Presence (embodied consciousness)
   - Cohesion (intersubjective bonds) 
   - Meaning (narrative identity)
3. **Methodological Innovation**: The Ástrós Paradox - using AI to map its own limitations
4. **Practical Framework**: Life-Value Development Compass (LVDC) for cultivation
5. **Economic Model**: The Cultivation Economy as alternative to extractive models

### Structure Identified

## Phase 2: Parallel Analysis Tasks (IN PROGRESS)
Launching 7 concurrent Tasks for deep domain analysis...

## Phase 3: Integration & Documentation (PENDING)
Will synthesize Task outputs into 6 comprehensive deliverables.
