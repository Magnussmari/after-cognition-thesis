# AI Research Assistant Utilization Report

**Date:** August 10, 2025
**Project:** After Cognition Thesis
**Folder:** `quality_control`

---

## Overview
This report documents the use of AI tools and agents as research assistants throughout the development, refinement, and quality control phases of the After Cognition thesis project. The following summary highlights key areas where AI has contributed to research, writing, editing, citation management, and quality assurance.

## AI Utilization Summary

### 1. Literature Review & Citation Management
- Automated retrieval and formatting of academic references (BibTeX entries).
- Replacement and updating of citations to ensure accuracy and currency (e.g., substituting fabricated or outdated sources with peer-reviewed articles).
- Cross-referencing and validation of sources within thesis chapters.

### 2. Chapter Editing & Content Integration
- Iterative editing of thesis chapters for citation accuracy, narrative coherence, and integration of new research findings.
- Automated search and replacement of references across multiple files.
- Assistance in integrating empirical evidence and philosophical arguments from diverse sources.

### 3. Quality Control & Technical Checks
- Automated scanning of chapter files for citation consistency and technical correctness.
- Support in maintaining a comprehensive bibliography and ensuring all references are properly cited.
- Generation of quality control reports and checklists to track improvements and compliance with academic standards.

### 4. Research Planning & Documentation
- Support in mapping integration plans (e.g., DiCarlo, wage premium, hispanic displacement) and tracking implementation progress.
- Assistance in summarizing chapter content and generating executive summaries.
- Documentation of daily achievements and enhancement summaries.

### 5. Collaboration & Review
- Facilitation of collaborative review processes, including detailed academic reviews and integration logs.
- Automated generation of summaries and recommendations for further refinement.

## Impact & Value Added
- **Efficiency:** Accelerated literature review, editing, and quality control processes.
- **Accuracy:** Improved citation reliability and reduced risk of referencing errors.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Enhanced integration of empirical, philosophical, and technical content.
- **Documentation:** Maintained transparent records of AI-assisted research activities for audit and reproducibility.

## Recommendations
- Continue leveraging AI for citation management, technical checks, and iterative editing.
- Document all major AI-assisted interventions for future reference and compliance.
- Periodically review AI-generated outputs for accuracy and alignment with project goals.
