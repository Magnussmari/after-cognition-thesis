## 1. MAJOR THEORETICAL SCHOOLS

### 1.1 Phenomenology & Continental Philosophy

#### Core Figures and Concepts:

**Edmund Husserl**
- **Lebenswelt (Lifeworld)**: The pre-theoretical lived world that serves as the ground of all experience
- Application: Foundation for understanding what AI cannot access - the semantic ground that gives symbols meaning
- Key text referenced: *Crisis of European Sciences* (1970)
- Relevance: Establishes the fundamental distinction between computational processing and lived experience

**Maurice Merleau-Ponty**
- **Body-subject**: The lived body through which we encounter the world (not the objective body studied by medicine)
- **Embodied perception**: Knowledge that emerges through bodily engagement with the world
- Application: Grounds the concept of "Presence" as irreducible embodied intelligence
- Key text: *Phenomenology of Perception* (1945)
- Relevance: Explains why proprioceptive knowledge and embodied wisdom resist algorithmic replication

**Martin Heidegger**
- **Being-toward-death**: The existential awareness of mortality that shapes authentic existence
- **Dasein**: Being-in-the-world as fundamentally temporal and finite
- Application: Mortality salience as irreducible human capacity
- Key text: *Being and Time* (1962)
- Relevance: AI lacks genuine stakes and finitude, cannot experience authentic being-toward-death

**Emmanuel Levinas**
- **Face-to-face encounter**: Ethics grounded in confrontation with the Other
- **Infinite responsibility**: The ethical demand that emerges from genuine encounter
- Application: Foundation for understanding intersubjective cohesion
- Key text: *Totality and Infinity* (1961)
- Relevance: True ethics requires vulnerability and stakes that AI cannot possess

**Alfred Schütz**
- **Social phenomenology**: Extension of phenomenology to social reality
- **Participatory knowledge**: Understanding that must be lived, not uploaded
- Key text: *Phenomenology of the Social World* (1967)
- Application: Explains why social bonds require mutual vulnerability

#### Phenomenological Synthesis in the Thesis:
- The three domains (Presence, Cohesion, Meaning) emerge directly from phenomenological analysis
- "Irreducibility" defined phenomenologically: first-person experience that cannot be third-person computed
- The "what-it-is-likeness" (qualia) as architectural boundary between human and AI

### 1.2 Economic Theory

#### General Purpose Technology (GPT) Theory
- Core concept: Technologies that improve rapidly, diffuse pervasively, spawn complementary innovations
- Application: Positions generative AI as a GPT with unprecedented speed of diffusion
- Key characteristics applied:
  - Exponential capability improvement
  - Pervasive application across domains
  - Spawning of complementary innovations
- Relevance: Explains the speed and scope of the commoditization crisis

#### Labor Economics
- **Skill-biased technological change**: How technology affects different skill levels
- **Wage premium analysis**: Empirical tracking of returns to human capital
- Key findings integrated:
  - AI uniquely targets high-skill cognitive work
  - Wage premiums shifting to emotional intelligence and creativity
  - Complementarity vs substitution effects
- Authors referenced: Autor (2015), Deming (2024), various McKinsey reports

#### Value Theory
- **Commoditization vs Commodification**: Careful distinction maintained
  - Commoditization: Market process making goods undifferentiated
  - Commodification: Transformation of non-market relations into market goods
- **Scarcity inversion**: AI makes scarce cognitive skills abundant, abundant human capacities scarce
- **Authenticity premiums**: Markets developing mechanisms to value human origin

#### Life-Value Onto-Axiology (John McMurtry)
- **Life-sequence vs Money-sequence**: Distinction between life-enabling and life-disabling economic circuits
- **Civil Commons**: Economic structures that enable rather than extract human capacity
- Application: Philosophical foundation for the Cultivation Economy
- Relevance: Provides normative framework for evaluating economic arrangements
- Note: Giorgio Baruchello's extensive work on McMurtry provides the bridge to this framework

### 1.3 Neuroscience & Psychology

#### Embodied Cognition
- **Somatic marker hypothesis** (Damasio): Emotional/bodily states guide decision-making
- **Interoception**: Awareness of internal bodily signals
- **Proprioception**: Body position and movement awareness
- Application: Scientific validation of embodied presence as irreducible
- Key findings:
  - Insular cortex maps internal states
  - Expertise physically reshapes the brain
  - Embodied practice creates structural neural changes

#### Social Neuroscience
- **Mirror neuron systems**: Neural basis for empathy and social learning
- **Oxytocin/vasopressin**: Neurochemicals of bonding requiring physical presence
- **Attachment theory**: Bonds formed through mutual vulnerability
- Application: Biological basis for irreducible cohesion
- Relevance: Shows why AI cannot form genuine social bonds

#### Consciousness Studies
- **Hard problem of consciousness** (Chalmers): Distinction between functional processes and phenomenal experience
- **Default Mode Network**: Neural substrate for self-narrative and meaning-making
- **Episodic vs semantic memory**: Personal experience vs facts
- Application: Neuroscientific validation of all three domains
- Key insight: Consciousness requires lived temporal experience

#### Positive Psychology
- **Post-traumatic growth** (Tedeschi): Transformation of suffering into wisdom
- **Flow states** (Csikszentmihalyi): Optimal experience through embodied engagement
- **Meaning-making**: Narrative identity construction (McAdams)
- Application: Psychological validation of meaning as irreducible domain

### 1.4 Critical Theory & Political Economy

#### Labor Process Theory
- Analysis of how work is organized and controlled
- Application: Understanding AI as latest stage in labor commoditization
- Focus on power dynamics in technological deployment

#### Stratification Theory
- Analysis of how technological change affects different social groups
- Key findings integrated:
  - Hispanic workers: 25.5% displacement risk
  - Black workers: 23.1% displacement risk
  - Facial recognition bias cases
- Application: Ensures cultivation economy addresses those most affected

## 2. NON-WESTERN PHILOSOPHICAL INTEGRATION

### 2.1 Ubuntu Philosophy (Southern African)

**Core Concept**: "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" - a person is a person through other persons

**Integration with Framework**:
- **Radical relationality**: Individual existence is ontologically dependent on community
- **Challenges Western individualism**: The three domains are not separate but interpenetrating
- **Enriches Cohesion domain**: Not just bonds between individuals but constitutive interdependence
- **Key insight**: AI cannot participate in "we-consciousness" that constitutes personhood itself

**Application**: Ubuntu reveals that cohesion is not just valuable but constitutive of human being

### 2.2 Daoist Thought

**Core Concepts**: 
- Wu wei (無為): Acting in accordance with natural patterns
- Flow and non-dualistic presence
- Dissolving subject-object distinction while maintaining agency

**Integration with Framework**:
- **Alternative understanding of Presence**: Not just embodied awareness but harmonious flow
- **Paradox of action/non-action**: Irreducible because it requires lived navigation of paradox
- **Process over substance**: Presence as continuous becoming rather than static state

**Application**: Enriches understanding of why AI cannot achieve genuine presence - it processes but doesn't flow

### 2.3 Buddhist Philosophy

**Core Concepts**:
- Anatta (non-self): No permanent, unchanging self
- Dukkha: Suffering as fundamental aspect of existence
- Impermanence: All phenomena are transitory

**Integration with Framework**:
- **Challenges fixed identity**: Yet affirms consciousness as continuous becoming
- **Suffering as teacher**: Links to post-traumatic growth and meaning-making
- **Meditation and mindfulness**: Practical cultivation methods for presence
- **Key insight**: Consciousness arises from causes/conditions AI lacks (suffering, impermanence, liberation-seeking)

**Application**: Shows irreducibility lies not in what consciousness IS but what drives its arising

### 2.4 Liberation Philosophy (Latin American)

**Core Thinker**: Enrique Dussel

**Key Concepts**:
- Philosophy emerging from concrete suffering and resistance
- "Preferential option for the poor"
- Praxis over abstract theory

**Integration with Framework**:
- **Grounds Meaning in struggle**: Not abstract reflection but concrete resistance
- **Demands justice focus**: Cultivation economy must prioritize the oppressed
- **Embodied philosophy**: Theory emerging from lived experience of injustice
- **Political urgency**: Philosophy as tool for liberation, not contemplation

**Application**: Ensures cultivation economy addresses stratified reality of AI impact

### 2.5 Indigenous Perspectives

While not extensively detailed in the thesis, Indigenous perspectives are acknowledged as:
- Offering different ways of parsing the irreducible
- Potentially rejecting nature/culture boundaries implicit in Western analysis
- Requiring respectful engagement and avoiding appropriation
- Essential for truly global understanding of human value

**Key Recognition**: The thesis explicitly states these perspectives would reveal "different territories" of the irreducible

## 3. INTERDISCIPLINARY CONNECTIONS

### 3.1 Philosophy ↔ Economics

**Phenomenology validates economic observations**:
- Lived experience explains why certain capacities command premiums
- Irreducibility creates scarcity that drives value concentration
- Life-Value Onto-Axiology provides normative framework for economic design

**Economics grounds philosophical claims**:
- Wage premium data validates irreducibility thesis
- Market behavior reveals what humans actually value
- GPT theory explains urgency of philosophical questions

**Synthesis**: The Value Concentration Hypothesis emerges from this intersection

### 3.2 Philosophy ↔ Neuroscience

**Phenomenology anticipated by neuroscience**:
- Embodied cognition research validates Merleau-Ponty's body-subject
- Default Mode Network corresponds to narrative self (Meaning domain)
- Mirror neurons validate Levinas's intersubjective ethics

**Neuroscience validates phenomenological claims**:
- Brain imaging shows structural changes from embodied practice
- Neurochemistry of bonding requires genuine vulnerability
- Consciousness emerges from embodied, temporal existence

**Synthesis**: "Correlates vs constituents" discussion shows these are complementary, not competing

### 3.3 Economics ↔ Psychology

**Psychological research informs economic models**:
- Post-traumatic growth explains meaning premiums
- Flow states validate presence as economic value
- Attachment theory grounds trust economics

**Economic pressures drive psychological adaptation**:
- AI anxiety as rational response to commoditization
- Meaning crisis as economic not just spiritual phenomenon
- Cultivation as psychological necessity not luxury

**Synthesis**: The "neurobiological imperative" section unifies these perspectives

### 3.4 All Disciplines → Irreducibility

The thesis demonstrates how different disciplines converge on the same insight:
- **Philosophy**: First-person experience irreducible to third-person description
- **Economics**: Certain human capacities resist commoditization
- **Neuroscience**: Consciousness requires embodied, mortal substrate
- **Psychology**: Meaning emerges from lived experience of suffering/growth
- **Non-Western thought**: Confirms and enriches understanding of irreducible domains

## 4. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS

### 4.1 The Ástrós Paradox

**Named after**: The author's wife, whose irreducible presence catalyzed the work

**Core Method**: Using AI to map its own limitations
- Push language models to breaking points
- Document systematic failures
- Analyze patterns of what cannot be computed

**Philosophical grounding**: 
- Paradoxical but not contradictory
- Like using MRI to reveal what bones cannot show
- Transforms AI from threat to diagnostic tool

**Implementation**:
1. Domain selection (hypothesized irreducible capacity)
2. Task design (prompts requiring genuine engagement)
3. Failure documentation
4. Pattern analysis across domains

**Key findings**:
- "Uncanny valley of wisdom" - perfect form, absent substance
- Wisdom without wounds
- Morality without genuine choice
- Connection without vulnerability

### 4.2 Life-Value Onto-Axiology Influence

**Source**: John McMurtry's philosophical framework, introduced via Giorgio Baruchello

**Core distinctions**:
- Life-value vs exchange-value
- Life-sequence vs money-sequence
- Civil commons vs private capital

**Application in thesis**:
- Grounds critique of commoditization
- Provides alternative economic vision
- Shapes Cultivation Economy proposal
- Influences ethical framework throughout

**Methodological contribution**:
- Normative clarity about what enables vs disables life
- Systematic evaluation of economic arrangements
- Bridge between philosophy and practical policy

### 4.3 Hybrid Human-AI Research Methods

**Documented in Appendix A**:
- "Constraining Framework Strategy" - using obscure frameworks to prevent pattern matching
- "Axiological Steering Protocol" - emotional prompting for value alignment
- "Recursive Feedback Loop" - iterative refinement revealing meaning-making patterns

**Philosophical significance**:
- Demonstrates hybrid collaboration while preserving human agency
- Shows how meaning emerges through interaction
- Validates irreducibility thesis through method itself

**Ethical considerations**:
- Transparency about AI assistance
- Clear documentation of human vs AI contributions
- Method as finding - reveals boundaries of computation

### 4.4 Phenomenological-Empirical Integration

**Unique methodological contribution**:
- Begins with phenomenological analysis (first-person)
- Validates with neuroscience (third-person objective)
- Confirms through economics (market behavior)
- Tests via AI failures (computational limits)

**Key principle**: Multiple lines of evidence converging on same territories

**Innovation**: Uses each method's strengths to compensate for others' weaknesses

   - Buddhist/Daoist thought emphasizes flux
   - Partial resolution through "cultivation" emphasis on development

4. **Philosophical Idealism vs Material Reality**:
   - High philosophical concepts vs stratified economic reality
   - Risk of cultivation being elite privilege
   - Addressed through extensive discussion of democratic access

5. **Temporal Horizons**:
   - 5-10 year focus vs longer-term possibilities
   - Current architectural constraints vs future developments
   - Explicitly framed as provisional, time-bound analysis

**Productive Gaps**:

1. **Measurement Challenge**:
   - How to operationalize phenomenological concepts
   - LVDC proposed but not fully developed
   - Opens space for future empirical research

2. **Political Implementation**:
   - Gap between vision and pathway
   - Sketch provided but details left open
   - Acknowledges need for collective development

3. **Cross-Cultural Validation**:
   - Western framework requiring global adaptation
   - Specific methods for cultural translation not fully developed
   - Invitation for parallel frameworks from other traditions

## CONCLUSION

This theoretical mapping reveals "After Cognition" as a work of remarkable philosophical ambition and integration. The thesis succeeds in:

1. **Synthesizing multiple theoretical traditions** into a coherent framework
2. **Grounding philosophical claims** in empirical evidence
3. **Maintaining critical awareness** of its own limitations and cultural specificity
4. **Providing practical guidance** while avoiding prescriptive universalism
5. **Opening new methodological approaches** to human-AI interaction

The theoretical frameworks employed are not merely academic exercises but tools for understanding and navigating a profound civilizational transformation. The integration of phenomenology's depth, neuroscience's rigor, economics' pragmatism, and non-Western wisdom creates a rich theoretical tapestry adequate to the complexity of the challenge.

Most significantly, the thesis demonstrates that theoretical sophistication need not come at the expense of practical application. By grounding its philosophical insights in economic reality and human need, it provides both a diagnosis of our current crisis and a prescription for cultivation that honors the irreducible value of human experience in all its diversity.
