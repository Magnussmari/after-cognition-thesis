*A comprehensive network showing how all major concepts interconnect across economic, phenomenological, methodological, and political dimensions*

## Core Conceptual Architecture

### The Central Nexus: Value Concentration Hypothesis

**Definition**: As AI commoditizes the computable, human value migrates to and concentrates in domains architecturally irreducible to computation.

**Cross-Domain Connections**:
- **Economic**: Creates market premiums for authenticated human services
- **Phenomenological**: Grounded in Husserl's Lebenswelt as computationally inaccessible
- **Methodological**: Validated through Ástrós Paradox systematic failures
- **Political**: Drives need for cultivation economy and democratic access
- **Empirical**: Confirmed by wage premium data and displacement patterns

## Master Synthesis

The thesis reveals a profound coherence: every major concept connects to and reinforces the others across all dimensions. The Value Concentration Hypothesis emerges not as abstract theory but as observable reality validated through multiple lenses. The three irreducible domains prove inseparable—presence enables cohesion enables meaning in an integrated whole that generates economic value precisely because it cannot be computationally replicated.

The frameworks provided—LVDC, monitor/treater, three-tier transformation—offer practical bridges from individual experience to civilizational change. The evidence converges from neuroscience, economics, psychology, and philosophy to validate what wisdom traditions have long known: human value lies in what requires genuine life, vulnerable connection, and meaning-making through time.

Most critically, the political economy connections show how individual cultivation requires and enables collective transformation. The window is narrow but the path is clear: cultivate what makes us irreducibly human while building systems that support rather than extract this cultivation. Every concept points toward the same conclusion—we must become gardeners of human value in the age of artificial intelligence.
