# After Cognition: Theoretical Frameworks & Scholarly Influences

*A comprehensive analysis of the philosophical foundations, interdisciplinary synthesis, and scholarly contributions shaping "After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility"*

---

## Major Theoretical Schools

### Phenomenology & Continental Philosophy

The thesis grounds its understanding of irreducibility in the phenomenological tradition, drawing most heavily from:

#### **Edmund Husserl** (Primary Influence)
- **Key Concept**: *Lebenswelt* (Lifeworld) - the pre-theoretical lived world that serves as the ground of all experience
- **Texts**: *The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology* (1970)
- **Application**: Establishes fundamental distinction between computational processing (manipulating representations) and lived experience (the semantic ground giving symbols meaning)
- **Relevance**: AI cannot access the lifeworld because it operates on symbols without the experiential ground that gives them meaning

#### **Maurice Merleau-Ponty** (Primary Influence)
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - *Body-subject*: The lived body through which we encounter the world
  - *Embodied perception*: Knowledge emerging through bodily engagement
- **Texts**: *Phenomenology of Perception* (1945)
- **Application**: Grounds the concept of "Presence" as irreducible embodied intelligence
- **Examples**: Mechanic diagnosing by vibration, nurse sensing fever break, parent's protective reflexes

#### **Martin Heidegger**
- **Key Concepts**:
  - *Being-toward-death*: Existential awareness of mortality shaping authentic existence
  - *Dasein*: Being-in-the-world as fundamentally temporal and finite
- **Texts**: *Being and Time* (1962)
- **Application**: Mortality salience as architecturally irreducible to computation
- **Insight**: AI lacks genuine stakes and finitude, cannot experience authentic being-toward-death

#### **Emmanuel Levinas**
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Face-to-face encounter as ethical foundation
  - Infinite responsibility emerging from genuine encounter
- **Texts**: *Totality and Infinity* (1961)
- **Application**: Foundation for understanding intersubjective cohesion
- **Relevance**: True ethics requires vulnerability and stakes AI cannot possess

#### **Alfred Schütz**
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Social phenomenology extending to intersubjective reality
  - Participatory knowledge that must be lived
- **Texts**: *The Phenomenology of the Social World* (1967)
- **Application**: Explains why social bonds require mutual vulnerability

### Economic Theory

#### **General Purpose Technology (GPT) Framework**
- **Core Insight**: Technologies that improve rapidly, diffuse pervasively, spawn complementary innovations
- **Application to AI**:
  - Exponential capability improvement (context windows, inference costs)
  - Pervasive application across all information-intensive domains
  - Spawning complementary innovations in business models and applications
- **Significance**: Explains unprecedented speed of the commoditization crisis

#### **Labor Economics**
- **Key Scholars**: David H. Autor, McKinsey Global Institute, Edward Felten
- **Core Findings**:
  - AI uniquely targets high-skill cognitive work
  - Wage premiums shifting to emotional intelligence and creativity
  - Stratified displacement: 25.5% Hispanic workers, 23.1% Black workers at risk
- **Application**: Empirical validation of value concentration hypothesis

#### **Value Theory & Life-Value Onto-Axiology**
- **Key Figures**: John McMurtry (via Giorgio Baruchello)
- **Core Distinctions**:
  - Life-sequence vs Money-sequence
  - Civil Commons vs Private Capital
  - Life-value vs Exchange-value
- **Application**: Philosophical foundation for Cultivation Economy
- **Innovation**: Bridges abstract philosophy with concrete economic design

### Neuroscience & Psychology

#### **Embodied Cognition**
- **Key Figure**: Antonio Damasio
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Somatic marker hypothesis: Emotional/bodily states guide decision-making
  - Interoception: Awareness of internal bodily signals
  - Proprioception: Body position and movement awareness
- **Validation**: Insular cortex mapping, neuroplasticity from embodied practice
- **Application**: Scientific basis for Presence as irreducible domain

#### **Social Neuroscience**
- **Key Researchers**: Giacomo Rizzolatti, C. Sue Carter
- **Core Findings**:
  - Mirror neuron systems enabling empathy
  - Oxytocin/vasopressin requiring physical presence
  - Attachment through mutual vulnerability
- **Application**: Biological basis for irreducible Cohesion

#### **Consciousness Studies**
- **Key Figure**: David Chalmers
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Hard problem of consciousness: Functional vs phenomenal experience
  - Qualia: Subjective experience irreducible to description
  - Default Mode Network: Neural substrate for self-narrative
- **Application**: Distinguishes what AI processes from what humans experience

#### **Positive Psychology**
- **Key Researchers**: Tedeschi & Calhoun, Keltner & Haidt, Dan McAdams
- **Core Contributions**:
  - Post-traumatic growth: Transformation of suffering
  - Awe and self-transcendence
  - Narrative identity construction
- **Application**: Psychological validation of Meaning domain

### Critical Theory & Political Economy

#### **Labor Process Theory**
- Analysis of how work is organized and controlled
- AI as latest stage in labor commoditization
- Focus on power dynamics in technological deployment

#### **Stratification Analysis**
- Documentation of differential impacts by race/class
- Facial recognition bias amplifying injustice
- Systemic barriers to reskilling and adaptation

## Non-Western Philosophical Integration

### **Ubuntu Philosophy** (Southern African)
- **Core Principle**: "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" (a person is a person through other persons)
- **Key Insights**:
  - Radical relationality: Individual existence ontologically dependent on community
  - We-consciousness as constitutive of personhood
  - AI cannot participate in collective consciousness that creates identity
- **Application**: Enriches understanding of Cohesion as constitutive, not just valuable

### **Daoist Thought**
- **Core Concepts**: Wu wei (無為) - acting in accordance with natural patterns
- **Key Insights**:
  - Presence as harmonious flow, not just awareness
  - Dissolving subject-object distinction while maintaining agency
  - Process over substance
- **Application**: Alternative framework for Presence beyond Western phenomenology

### **Buddhist Philosophy**
- **Core Concepts**: Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering), Impermanence
- **Key Insights**:
  - Consciousness as continuous becoming
  - Suffering as teacher linking to post-traumatic growth
  - Meditation as cultivation practice
- **Application**: Shows irreducibility lies in what drives consciousness, not fixed identity

### **Liberation Philosophy** (Latin American)
- **Key Figure**: Enrique Dussel
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Philosophy from concrete suffering and resistance
  - Preferential option for the poor
  - Praxis over abstract theory
- **Application**: Grounds Meaning in struggle, ensures cultivation addresses oppression

### **Indigenous Perspectives**
- Acknowledged as offering different territories of irreducibility
- Rejecting nature/culture boundaries implicit in Western analysis
- Requiring respectful engagement without appropriation

## Synthesis Achievement

The thesis succeeds in:
1. **Synthesizing multiple traditions** into coherent framework
2. **Grounding philosophy** in empirical evidence
3. **Maintaining critical awareness** of limitations
4. **Providing practical guidance** without prescriptive universalism
