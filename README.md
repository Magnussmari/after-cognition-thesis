# After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility

## About the Thesis

**"After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility"**

This thesis investigates how generative AI transforms human value through the **Value Concentration Hypothesis**: as AI handles computable tasks, economic and existential value concentrates in three irreducible human domains:

1. **Presence** (embodied intelligence)
2. **Cohesion** (intersubjective bonds)  
3. **Meaning** (narrative identity)

## Key Arguments

### The Value Concentration Hypothesis
Human value will shift and concentrate in domains that are not isomorphic to current computational architectures.

### Three Domains of Irreducible Value
1. **Presence**: Embodied consciousness, qualia, mortality salience
2. **Cohesion**: Trust beyond transaction, reciprocity, collective effervescence
3. **Meaning**: Narrative identity, integration of suffering, self-transcendence

### The Cultivation Economy
An economic model focused on developing, rather than extracting, human capacity in these irreducible domains.
