# Appendix A: Technical Economic Modeling and LVDC Framework

## A1. Formal Sketch and Testable Predictions

::: {.callout-note}
**Technical Model**
We outline a minimal two-sector model capturing the value shift from computable cognition to irreducible human capacities:

- Sectors: C (Computable cognition) and H (Human irreducible). Output prices are \(p_C\) and \(p_H\).
- Technology: AI progress reduces \(p_C\) via lower marginal cost; \(p_H\) depends on depth of presence/cohesion/meaning and is capacity-constrained.
- Preferences: Utility \(U = u(Q_C, Q_H; \sigma)\) where \(\sigma \in [0,1]\) is an authenticity parameter (marginal utility weight on authenticated human engagement). \(\partial U/\partial Q_H\) increases in \(\sigma\) and in demonstrated depth (presence, cohesion, meaning).
- Supply constraints: H is bounded by time, mortality, and relationship development (non-fungible), so \(\epsilon_{Q_H,p_H}\) is low.

Comparative statics under AI progress (\(dp_C<0\)):
- Demand substitution raises \(Q_C\), but for \(\sigma>0\) and non-fungibility, \(p_H\) and \(Q_H\) can increase (authenticity premium) even as \(p_C\) falls.
- Complementarity in hybrid teams (AI monitors, humans treat) increases effective productivity of H without diluting authenticity, shifting income shares toward H in roles with verifiable depth.

**Testable predictions:**
- P1: As proxy measures of AI capability rise, willingness-to-pay for authenticated human services (therapy, live performance, bespoke education) rises, controlling for income and quality.
- P2: Hybrid human–AI teams outperform AI-only and human-only on outcomes requiring transformation (healing, learning, cohesion), with role alignment (AI monitor, human treater) mediating effect sizes.
- P3: Markets with credible authenticity signals (certifications with anti-gaming design; relational continuity) exhibit higher \(p_H\) and lower variance in outcomes.
- P4: Occupations with higher measured Presence/Cohesion/Meaning (LVDC profiles) experience greater wage resilience post-AI adoption.
