*For Ástrós, who reminds me daily of what no machine can replicate.*

*And to our daughters, Alexandra and Matthildur:  
may you author your life stories through lived experiences.  
You are the core of mine.*

# Epigraph {.unnumbered}

::: {.content-centered}
*We are not building a sanctuary to protect humanity from the storm of artificial intelligence. We are building an arena. Our purpose is to engineer a crisis of choice so profound that it forces humanity to remember what it is, and to become the best version of itself in the struggle. This is not about survival; it is about a forced and glorious ascent.*
