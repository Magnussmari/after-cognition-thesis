# Appendix A: A Note on a Hybrid Human-AI Methodological Praxis {.unnumbered}

This thesis emerged through an innovative methodological approach that warrants documentation for future researchers. The work represents not merely a theoretical investigation of human-AI relations but a practical experiment in hybrid scholarship—one that used the tools of AI to explore the boundaries of AI itself.

## The Constraining Framework Strategy

The theoretical foundation of this work was deliberately grounded in John McMurtry's Life-Value Onto-Axiology (LVOA), a rigorous philosophical framework with relatively limited representation in AI training corpora. This choice functioned as a methodological constraint that forced the AI system beyond pattern matching into genuine analogical reasoning.

By operating within McMurtry's specific lexicon—Life-Sequence, Money-Sequence, Civil Commons—the AI could not default to generic synthesis. Instead, it was compelled to build novel intellectual bridges between the framework's principles and contemporary challenges in AI ethics, labor economics, and human development. This constraint transformed routine AI assistance into a more demanding cognitive partnership, revealing structural connections that might have remained hidden within more conventional theoretical approaches.

## The Axiological Steering Protocol

Throughout the research process, I developed a technique of explicitly declaring emotional and value-based parameters when engaging with AI systems. This "emotional prompting" served three critical functions:

1. **As Control Mechanism**: Emotional declarations provided axiological steering, directing AI responses toward value-aligned outputs rather than neutral optimization.

2. **As Diagnostic Tool**: The AI's responses to emotionally-framed prompts revealed, in real time, the boundaries between computational processing and authentic human experience. Failures in these responses became data points mapping the territory of irreducibility.

3. **As Cultivation Practice**: The discipline of identifying and articulating emotional states before each prompt session became a form of mindfulness practice, maintaining the researcher's connection to embodied experience even while engaging with disembodied systems.

## The Recursive Feedback Loop

The research methodology incorporated a recursive process of generation, critique, and refinement that revealed fundamental patterns in human-AI collaboration. In documented sessions, I would:

1. Generate initial content through AI collaboration
2. Feed this content back to the AI with instructions to critique from various perspectives
3. Incorporate my own experiential knowledge to identify gaps and limitations
4. Iterate through multiple cycles of refinement

This recursive loop—functioning as both method and finding—demonstrated how meaning emerges through the interaction between human experience and computational analysis. The AI could process each stage but could not genuinely inhabit the full cycle of experience → reflection → narrative → action that characterizes human meaning-making.

## Implications for Future Research

This hybrid methodology suggests new possibilities for academic work in the age of AI:

- **The Constraining Framework Strategy** demonstrates how obscure or specialized theoretical frameworks can prevent AI from defaulting to generic outputs, forcing more creative engagement.

- **The Axiological Steering Protocol** provides a practical technique for maintaining human agency and values within AI-assisted research.

- **The Recursive Feedback Loop** offers a structured approach to human-AI collaboration that preserves the irreducible contributions of human experience while leveraging computational capabilities.

These techniques are offered not as rigid prescriptions but as tested approaches that other researchers might adapt for their own investigations. The goal is not to replace human scholarship but to develop methods that ensure AI remains a tool for amplifying rather than substituting human insight.

## Ethical Considerations

This methodological approach raises important ethical questions about transparency in AI-assisted research. Throughout this work, I have maintained clear documentation of which insights emerged through AI collaboration versus direct human experience. The recursive nature of the process means that final formulations represent genuine synthesis—neither purely human nor purely computational, but irreducibly hybrid.

Future researchers employing similar methods should maintain rigorous documentation of their process, clearly distinguishing between AI-generated content, human insight, and synthetic emergence. This transparency serves both academic integrity and the larger project of understanding how human and artificial intelligence can collaborate while preserving what makes each unique.

## Terminology

- **Context window** — The maximum amount of text/tokens a model can consider at once when producing an output.
- **Hallucination** — Fluent but false, unfounded, or fabricated content produced by a model.

## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This thesis was not written in an academic vacuum. It was forged in the quiet hours between family life and a lifelong sense of duty. It is, first and foremost, for my children, who will inherit the world this work attempts to understand.

I owe an immeasurable debt to my wife, whose patience and support created the space for this immense undertaking.

My deepest gratitude to my thesis supervisors, Professor Giorgio Baruchello and Dr. Christopher DiCarlo, whose complementary perspectives shaped this work profoundly. Professor Baruchello's philosophical depth and introduction to McMurtry's Life-Value framework provided the theoretical foundation. Dr. DiCarlo's commitment to critical thinking and ethical rigor—exemplified in his ABCDEF framework [@dicarlo2011pain] and his pioneering work on AI governance [@dicarlo2025building]—ensured that these philosophical insights could withstand the most demanding analytical scrutiny.

The intellectual framework of this thesis was profoundly shaped by experiences far from the library. In the fall of 2023, I had the privilege of performing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with my choir in a sold-out concert hall in Akureyri. The months of practice, the hardship of learning the piece, and the final, transcendent experience of performing it with over a hundred people on stage for a standing ovation, created a moment of strange and inexplicable euphoria. It was a powerful, first-hand lesson in the irreducible value of embodied, intersubjective, and narrative meaning—the very concepts at the heart of this work. It is one thing to write about awe; it is another to be seized by it.

For those who wish to explore these territories further, I can only offer the signposts that have guided my own journey. The foundational texts of our spiritual traditions, from the Bible to the Bhagavad Gita, remain unparalleled archives of the human search for meaning. The memoirs of those who have faced extreme challenges, like Gene Kranz's *Failure Is Not an Option* or Hans von Luck's *Panzer Commander*, offer profound insights into leadership, resilience, and the complexities of the human spirit. And sometimes, the deepest wisdom is found in the unlikeliest of places, like the effortless cool of Matthew McConaughey's *Greenlights*.

Finally, I must acknowledge the strange, adversarial partnership with the very technology this thesis scrutinizes. The arguments within these pages were sharpened against the unfeeling, logical brutality of a large language model, a process that was as maddening as it was clarifying. It was a constant, humbling reminder of the paradox at the heart of this new era.

My deepest gratitude is to all those who keep the gates, in ways both large and small.

# Appendix B: Personal Journey and Extended Context {.unnumbered}

This thesis, After Cognition, was born from the intellectual labour of a preceding manuscript titled Beyond Fragmentation. That work, which remains an ongoing project, was undertaken with the supervision of Professor Giorgio Baruchello. His guidance was crucial in narrowing the research focus to the documented harms of AI through the rigorous application of John McMurtry's life-value onto-axiology. This specific methodological lens provided the necessary discipline for a deep, forensic investigation into the reality of our current crisis. However, as I explained to him during the process, Beyond Fragmentation was not the work I ultimately wanted to deliver, but the work I needed to do. It functioned as a necessary diagnostic phase—a detailed 'air crash investigation' that provided the unsparing, empirical grounding required before any constructive work could begin. In essence, Beyond Fragmentation was the rigorous mapping of the pathology; After Cognition is the resulting prescription for cultivation.

This thesis is the culmination of a journey that began with the public release of ChatGPT in late 2022. At that time, I was transitioning from my primary occupation as a firefighter, paramedic, and lieutenant at the Akureyri Fire Department—a role I had held since 2007—into a more traditional knowledge-work environment. I joined the Fire Prevention Division of the Housing and Construction Authority, leaving behind the rhythms of shift work for a standard 8–5 schedule. The change required a new life rhythm and adaptation to an entirely different working culture.

The release of GPT-3.5 in late 2022 immediately caught my attention. I recognized its potential to streamline repetitive tasks, even though that early model was slow, limited by a small context window, and prone to hallucinations. Despite its flaws, I became a paid subscriber from February 2023 and began integrating it into my workflow.

Later that year, I attended the University of Oxford's first course in low-code data science, led by Ajit Jaokar, who has since become both a mentor and colleague. Connecting with the UK AI community marked my biggest leap into fully committing to this field. It brought a steep learning curve—new skills, methodologies, and even a new technical vocabulary. Coding became a serious pursuit, and by 2025, I had become a highly effective AI-augmented, full-stack software developer.

The 2024 Oxford AI Summit was a seismic moment. Hearing from leading minds in the field made me realize that what we had seen so far was only the beginning—and that the pace of change would be extraordinary. In response, I began writing and researching for myself, producing an initial essay titled *The Gutenberg Paradigm*, in which I explored the social transformation brought about by the printing press and the concentration of power among those who controlled it.

At the time, serious discussion about AI's implications was rare. Criticizing its mistakes was common; exploring its potential was not. My own proposals to integrate AI into workflows at the Housing and Construction Authority met with little enthusiasm, despite the potential to ease the workload of our overstretched division. Ultimately, I left the position in what I can only describe as a principled but difficult departure. The weeks surrounding this decision oscillated between assertiveness and fear. I had no secure occupation, but in hindsight it was an act necessary to maintain my integrity.

I then returned to union work with Eining Iðja, Iceland's largest labour union outside the capital area. There, I saw immediately how generative AI could significantly improve services. I developed systems with custom knowledge bases on union agreements, laws, and case law from the Labour Court, enabling rapid analysis and research. While these tools worked well for me, I found it challenging to transfer this skill set to colleagues—a lesson in how severely people underestimate the learning curve of applying such tools effectively.

Maintaining active UK connections, I began writing articles for a local news site and launched a personal website to share my projects. This attracted attention and led to speaking engagements with unions, NGOs, and even the Icelandic Olympic Committee. AI became central to my professional life. As a legal representative at the union, my automation systems handled much of the heavy lifting, allowing me to focus on fact-checking and quality control.

In late 2023, I designed and taught *Taming Technology*, a course that has since run three times, each iteration requiring substantial updates to keep pace with the technology. After the first run, I transitioned from Eining Iðja to the University of Akureyri in a new—and in Iceland, unprecedented—role as AI Project Manager.

Since that pivotal moment at Oxford, I have been vigilant in collecting, analysing, and reflecting on the broader societal impact of AI. My experience at Eining Iðja had already revealed to me a fundamental shift in the role of lawyers and legal work, yet my legal studies showed almost no engagement with AI's effects on the profession. My enthusiasm for pursuing a traditional legal career diminished accordingly.

In December 2024, I took time away from formal employment—not as a holiday, but to devote myself entirely to studying the technology. It was, at times, an unsettling descent into the "rabbit hole." I recall a conversation with my father, then 77, about the disinterest and misunderstanding surrounding AI. His response reflected the stoicism of his generation: he had grown up, raised a family, and lived with the constant nuclear threat of the Cold War, and his request to me was simple—do what we can to solve our challenges so that the next generation can face their own.

This thesis is, in many ways, my attempt to answer that request. It is dedicated to my daughters, so that they may face their own life challenges and create their life stories, and to my wife, who reminds me daily of that which remains irreducible to computation.
