**Synopsis – Introduction: The Modern Midas Paradox & Value Concentration Hypothesis**

The introduction frames the thesis around the **Modern Midas Paradox**—an allegory for AI’s commoditization of cognition. Like King Midas turning all he touched into lifeless gold, society risks transforming the living qualities of human thought into abstract, fungible output, leaving us starved of **presence**, **cohesion**, and **meaning**. The harm is systemic, falling hardest on vulnerable groups such as displaced service workers and undervalued caregivers. The path forward, as in the myth, is to “wash our hands” of the curse by consciously reclaiming what is irreducibly alive.

This sets up the **Value Concentration Hypothesis**: as AI drives the marginal cost of cognitive labor toward zero, human value concentrates in domains architecturally irreducible to computation. The thesis unfolds in four parts:

1. Economic diagnosis of AI’s commoditizing effects on cognitive work.
2. Phenomenological mapping of irreducible value—Presence, Cohesion, and Meaning.
3. Economic modeling for valuing and cultivating these capacities.
4. A paradoxical method using AI to map its own limits and inform cultivation protocols.

The introduction grounds the work in the author’s lived experience as a paramedic-turned-researcher, while explicitly acknowledging cultural partiality and inviting alternative cartographies. It defines key terms—*irreducible* meaning non-embodied, non-mortal, non-risk-bearing under current architectures—and clarifies a taxonomy of limits (architectural, deployment-specific, contingent).

The methodological rationale defends a **first-person epistemology**, combining phenomenology and autoethnography to access lived-world data invisible to purely positivist approaches. This choice is framed as both an epistemic necessity and an ethical act aligned with the “Cultivation Economy” vision. Operational definitions for each domain are provided, linking phenomenological constructs to measurable indicators, setting the stage for the thesis’s analytical and prescriptive phases.
