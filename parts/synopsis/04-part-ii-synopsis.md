**Synopsis – Part II: A Lifeworld Cartography: Mapping the Territories of Irreducible Value**

This chapter maps three interdependent domains of human value that cannot be replicated by computation in principle: **Presence** (embodied, mortality-grounded awareness), **Cohesion** (trust and reciprocity through shared vulnerability), and **Meaning** (self-authored narratives integrating past, present, and future).

Drawing on Husserl’s *Lebenswelt* and extended through global philosophical traditions—including Ubuntu, Daoism, Buddhism, and liberation philosophy—the analysis establishes a cross-cultural foundation for irreducibility. Each domain is explored through phenomenology, empirical evidence, neuroscience, and grounded autoethnographic vignettes:

* **Presence**: From the tacit intelligence of skilled hands to the mortality salience shaping existential awareness, this section shows how embodied knowledge and interoception resist codification.
* **Cohesion**: Trust, reciprocity, and collective effervescence emerge only from mutual risk. Examples range from the sweat lodge to the lost ritual of the smoke break, supported by organizational and anthropological research.
* **Meaning**: Humans uniquely transform suffering into coherent life stories, drawing on episodic memory and narrative identity. Everyday examples parallel post-traumatic growth and self-transcendence through awe.

Neuroscientific findings—on the insular cortex, mirror neurons, oxytocin bonding, the default mode network—are integrated to show how these domains are biologically grounded in mortal, temporal existence. The “correlates vs. constituents” distinction clarifies that these features are not accidental substrates but arise from lived finitude.

A “limit case” from psychedelic research demonstrates all three domains operating at once, offering empirical validation of irreducibility. The chapter concludes that as AI commoditizes the computable, the value of these lived capacities does not diminish but concentrates, forming a core that must be cultivated and protected in the next 5–10 years of technological change.
