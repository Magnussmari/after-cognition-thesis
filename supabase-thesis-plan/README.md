# Supabase-Powered Academic Thesis Platform

## üéØ Vision Statement

Transform the "After Cognition" thesis from a static Quarto-generated site into a dynamic, database-driven platform that preserves academic rigor while delivering a modern reading experience.

## üöÄ Core Concept

**Hybrid Publishing Approach:**
- **Author Experience:** Continue using Quarto for writing (familiar academic workflow)
- **Reader Experience:** Dynamic web application powered by Supabase
- **Content Pipeline:** Automated sync from Quarto renders to database

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

- `01-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture and system design
- `02-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md` - Complete database design and migrations
- `03-IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md` - Step-by-step development roadmap
- `04-CONTENT-PIPELINE.md` - Quarto ‚Üí Supabase automation workflow
- `05-FRONTEND-DESIGN.md` - Modern reader interface specifications
- `06-ADVANCED-FEATURES.md` - Future enhancements and capabilities
- `07-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md` - Production deployment and hosting
- `08-BENEFITS-ANALYSIS.md` - Why this approach is superior

## üéØ Quick Start

1. Review the architecture overview in `01-ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Set up the database schema from `02-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md`
3. Follow Phase 1 implementation in `03-IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md`
4. Configure the content pipeline from `04-CONTENT-PIPELINE.md`

## üí° Key Innovation

This platform demonstrates the thesis themes in action - using technology to enhance human value rather than replace it. The system preserves scholarly writing workflows while dramatically improving the reading experience.
