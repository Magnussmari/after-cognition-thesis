# Selected Institutional Cases for "After Cognition" Thesis

## Overview
These cases demonstrate real-world implementation of your Value Concentration Hypothesis across sectors. Each explicitly responds to AI/automation by investing in irreducible human capacities (presence, cohesion, meaning).

## 1. Healthcare: Japan's Eldercare Robot Policy
**Key Citation**: @reuters2018robots

**Relevance to Thesis**:
- Government mandate that robots "will not replace human caregivers"
- Robots handle physical tasks (lifting, monitoring) to free staff for human interaction
- Perfect example of Monitor vs. Treater distinction from Part IV

**Integration Point**: Add to Part IV after UK MOJ example as international validation of your framework

## 2. Education: Finland's 2045 Vision
**Key Citation**: @ucl2025finland

**Relevance to Thesis**:
- Minister asks: "What must humans learn in an age where machines outperform us in most things?"
- Answer: Focus on qualities that "cannot and should not be automated" - empathy, creativity, ethical reasoning
- Curricula shifting from information transfer to wisdom cultivation

**Quote for Thesis**: "We need to uphold the human factor in the age of machines and artificial intelligence... the most profound of skills; the things that make us human" - Minister Anders Adlercreutz

**Integration Point**: Part III's educational reform section

## 3. Corporate: Toyota's Human-Powered Automation
**Key Citation**: @fastcompany2017toyota

**Relevance to Thesis**:
- Deliberately keeps automation at <8% despite capability for more
- "Machines are good for repetitive things, but they can't improve their own efficiency or the quality of their work. Only people can." - Wil James, Toyota Kentucky
- Workers shift from repetitive tasks to quality inspection, innovation, process refinement

**Integration Point**: Part III's hybrid economy model - perfect example of strategic human-AI complementarity

## 4. Corporate: Unilever's Purpose Program
**Key Citation**: @unilever2024wellbeing, @hbr2022purpose

**Relevance to Thesis**:
- 57,000 employees through "Discover Your Purpose" workshops
- 92% report feeling inspired to go extra mile after purpose workshop
- 4,000 "mental health champions" trained
- Explicitly frames meaning/cohesion as core business assets for AI age

**Integration Point**: Part III's meaning cultivation section

## 5. Policy: EU GDPR Article 22
**Key Citation**: @gdpr2018article22

**Relevance to Thesis**:
- Legal right to human review of algorithmic decisions
- Prohibits purely automated decisions with "legal or similarly significant effects"
- Enshrines "meaningful human oversight" in law
- Complements UK MOJ approach

**Integration Point**: Part IV alongside UK MOJ as trans-Atlantic validation

## 6. Community: Appalachian Coal Miner Retraining
**Key Citation**: @dol2024power, @ccdaily2020coal

**Relevance to Thesis**:
- Displaced miners retrained for "care economy" not just technical skills
- Shawn Rigney: 4th generation miner â†’ respiratory therapist
- "There is always a need for nurses, radiologists, physical therapist assistants"
- Community-led shift from extraction to care work

**Integration Point**: Part I's stratified reality section - shows pathway for displaced workers

## Recommendation for Integration

### Strongest 3 Cases to Add:
1. **Finland Education** - Government-level validation of wisdom over information
2. **Toyota Manufacturing** - Corporate example of deliberate human-AI balance
3. **EU GDPR Article 22** - Legal enshrinement of irreducible human judgment

These provide:
- Geographic diversity (Japan, Finland, EU, US)
- Sector diversity (healthcare, education, manufacturing, policy)
- Different scales (individual, organizational, societal)
- All explicitly cite AI/automation as driver
- All invest in your three domains (presence, cohesion, meaning)

### Integration Strategy:
- Add 1-2 paragraph summaries in relevant sections
- Use as empirical validation of theoretical claims
- Maintain focus on UK MOJ as primary detailed example
- Total addition: ~500-750 words across thesis
