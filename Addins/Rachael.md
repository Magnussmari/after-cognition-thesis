Based on my research into Professor Rachael Lorna Johnstone's work, I've found several compelling connections to your thesis "After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility" that would be highly appropriate to cite. Here are key aspects of her work that align with and could support your theoretical framework:

## Professor Rachael Lorna Johnstone's Profile

Rachael Lorna Johnstone is Professor of Law at the University of Akureyri, Iceland, and at Ilisimatusarfik (University of Greenland), specializing in **Polar Law** - the governance of the Arctic and Antarctic under international and domestic law. She's a leading expert on **indigenous rights**, **human rights law**, **environmental law**, and **community engagement in extractive industries**.[1][2][3]

## Key Works Relevant to Your Thesis

### 1. **"Regulation of Extractive Industries: Community Engagement in the Arctic" (2020)**

This co-edited volume with Anne Merrild Hansen directly addresses the **commodification versus community engagement** tension that underlies your thesis. Johnstone's work documents how Arctic communities demand **meaningful participation** in decisions affecting their lands and resources, not merely procedural consultation. This aligns powerfully with your **Value Concentration Hypothesis** by demonstrating that authentic human engagement becomes more valuable precisely when extractive industries attempt to reduce community relationships to mere compliance procedures.[3][4]

**Citation-worthy insight**: Johnstone's research in Greenland found that regardless of people's support or opposition to extractive projects, "there were two constant factors: they wanted more information, and they wanted to have an influence". This empirically validates your argument about the irreducible human need for **genuine agency** and **authentic participation**.[3]

### 2. **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) Framework**

Johnstone's extensive work on FPIC provides a legal framework that directly supports your thesis's emphasis on **irreducible human dignity**. In her 2016 Arctic Circle presentation, she breaks down FPIC into four crucial elements that resist commodification:[5]

- **Free**: "how is the autonomy of the community ensured?"
- **Prior**: "at what stages are concerned communities consulted?"  
- **Informed**: "how is information transferred to and from communities, including traditional knowledge?"
- **Consent**: "how is consent measured and confirmed?"[5]

This framework demonstrates that meaningful human participation cannot be reduced to algorithmic processes or standardized procedures - it requires **genuine relationship**, **temporal engagement**, and **authentic dialogue**.[5]

### 3. **Climate Justice and Human Rights**

Johnstone's work on climate justice provides crucial support for your argument about **existential emergency**. Her involvement in climate justice frameworks emphasizes that climate change "poses an effective obstacle to the continued progress of human rights" and requires "substantive legal and procedural rights relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment".[6]

**Citation-worthy connection**: Her climate justice work demonstrates how **environmental crises reveal irreducible human capacities** for collective decision-making, intergenerational responsibility, and moral reasoning that AI systems cannot replicate.[6]

## Specific Citation Recommendations

### For Your **Value Concentration Hypothesis**:
Cite Johnstone's findings that communities consistently demand **meaningful influence** over extractive projects, not just information or compensation. This empirically validates your argument that human value concentrates in domains requiring **genuine agency** and **relational depth**.[3]

### For Your **Presence, Cohesion, and Meaning** framework:
- **Presence**: Her work on indigenous traditional knowledge systems demonstrates **embodied wisdom** that cannot be digitized[5]
- **Cohesion**: Her FPIC research shows how community consent requires **genuine relationship** between stakeholders with real stakes[5]
- **Meaning**: Her climate justice work emphasizes **intergenerational responsibility** and **moral reasoning** about planetary futures[6]

### For Your **Existential Emergency** diagnosis:
Johnstone's climate justice framework explicitly treats climate change as a **human rights emergency** requiring immediate systemic intervention, not gradual adaptation. This provides legal and moral support for your **paramedic's diagnostic** approach.[6]

## Recommended Citation

For maximum impact, I recommend citing her **"Regulation of Extractive Industries"** work to support your argument that authentic human engagement becomes more valuable as systems attempt to commodify it:

> "As Rachael Lorna Johnstone's research in Arctic communities demonstrates, extractive industries may meet technical regulatory requirements while leaving 'the people most affected by their decisions...dissatisfied' because what communities fundamentally seek cannot be reduced to procedural compliance: 'they wanted more information, and they wanted to have an influence' (Johnstone & Hansen, 2020). This empirical finding validates the Value Concentration Hypothesisâ€”authentic human agency becomes more, not less, valuable as systems attempt to standardize and commodify community engagement."

## Strategic Value of This Citation

Citing Johnstone strengthens your thesis in several ways:

1. **Empirical Grounding**: Her fieldwork provides concrete evidence for your theoretical claims
2. **Legal Authority**: Her expertise in international law adds institutional weight 
3. **Indigenous Perspectives**: Her focus on indigenous rights brings non-Western philosophical frameworks
4. **Environmental Justice**: Connects your AI critique to broader climate justice movements
5. **Arctic Context**: Adds geographical and cultural diversity to your argument

Her work demonstrates that **irreducible human capacities** - the need for authentic participation, meaningful relationship, and genuine influence - become more valuable precisely when systems attempt to reduce them to standardized procedures. This provides powerful empirical support for your central thesis while honoring the wisdom of Arctic communities who have long resisted commodification of their relationships with land and each other.[3][6][5]
