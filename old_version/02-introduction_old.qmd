# Introduction

This thesis examines a fundamental economic and existential shift: as artificial intelligence commoditizes cognitive labor, driving its marginal cost toward zero, human value does not disappear but concentrates in domains that are architecturally irreducible to computation. I call this the Value Concentration Hypothesis, and it has profound implications for how we educate, work, and organize society in an AI-saturated future.

The investigation proceeds in four parts:

Part I establishes the economic reality: generative AI functions as a general-purpose technology that is rapidly commoditizing cognitive work. This creates unprecedented challenges for human workers and raises fundamental questions about the nature of value itself.

Part II maps the territories of irreducible human value through the phenomenological lens of the Lebenswelt. Three domains emerge: Presence (embodied intelligence), Cohesion (intersubjective bonds), and Meaning (narrative identity).

Part III develops an economic model for this value concentration, proposing frameworks for pricing and cultivating capacities that appreciate rather than depreciate as AI scales.

Part IV outlines the paradoxical method: using AI to map its own limits, developing discriminative indicators for irreducibility, and creating cultivation protocols for human development.

Throughout, "irreducible" means "not isomorphic to computation under present architectures"; it does not assert metaphysical impossibility. The aim is practical: to guide individuals, organizations, and societies toward investments in human capacities that will retain and increase their value as artificial intelligence transforms the economic landscape.

This thesis offers one map among many possible cartographies. Written from the particular vantage of a paramedic-turned-researcher, a father's love, and an Icelander's relationship with unforgiving nature, it necessarily bears the marks of its origins. Other perspectives—from different cultures, experiences, and ways of knowing—would undoubtedly reveal territories I cannot see. This limitation is not a flaw but a feature: irreducibility itself resists any single, totalizing account.

## The Ástrós Paradox (definition)

Using frontier AI systems to reveal, by their most capable failures, the human capacities they cannot inhabit—thus increasing the value of those capacities and showing where to invest in cultivation.

## Scope & Claims

"Irreducible" = not isomorphic to computation under present mainstream architectures (non-embodied, non-mortal, non-risk-bearing). Descriptive analysis (Ch. 1–2); predictive economics (Ch. 3) framed as contingent forecasts; prescriptive protocols (Ch. 4–5) with explicit limitations. Alternative futures (embodied/agentic AI) are acknowledged in §2.5.1; our recommendations target the near-term deployment reality.

## Operational Definitions

**Presence (Embodied Self)** - Sustained attention: mind-wandering probes (frequency of task-unrelated thoughts during 15-min intervals) - Interoceptive accuracy: heartbeat detection task performance (Schandry score) - Mortality reflection frequency: ecological momentary assessment of finitude awareness (daily prompts)

**Cohesion (Intersubjective We)** - Validated trust scale change: pre/post interaction scores on Interpersonal Trust Scale - Reciprocity index: ratio of giving to receiving behaviors in structured exchanges - Rupture–repair rate: frequency and resolution time of relationship conflicts (dyadic coding)

**Meaning (Narrative Arc)** - Narrative coherence score: trained coder ratings using McAdams Life Story Interview protocol - Post-adversity growth index: standardized Post-traumatic Growth Inventory scores - Purpose alignment checklist: self-reported congruence between daily actions and life goals
