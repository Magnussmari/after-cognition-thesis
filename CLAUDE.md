# CLAUDE.md - Project Context for After Cognition

## Project Overview
"After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility" - A philosophical thesis exploring human value domains that remain irreducible to computational processes in the age of generative AI.

## Thesis Structure
The thesis is written in Quarto markdown format and consists of:
- **Frontmatter**: Title, abstract, dedication
- **Prologue**: Setting the philosophical stage
- **Introduction**: The challenge of human value in the AI age
- **Part I**: The Economic and Existential Imperative - Defining the Commoditization Crisis
- **Part II**: A Lifeworld Cartography - Mapping the Territories of Irreducible Value
- **Part III**: The Architecture of Cultivation - From Theory to Practice
- **Part IV**: A Theory of Crisis Integration
- **Conclusion**: The Path Forward
- **Appendices**: Technical notes and supplementary material

## Key Concepts
1. **The Value Concentration Hypothesis**: Human value will shift and concentrate in domains not isomorphic to computational architectures
2. **Three Domains of Irreducible Value**:
   - **Presence**: Embodied consciousness and qualia
   - **Cohesion**: Intersubjective trust and community
   - **Meaning**: Narrative identity and self-authorship
3. **The Cultivation Economy**: An economic model focused on developing rather than extracting human capacity

## Working with the Thesis
- **Edit content**: Modify .qmd files in the `parts/` directory
- **Build HTML**: Run `quarto render` to generate docs
- **Citations**: Use `resources/AC_references.bib` for bibliography
- **Figures**: Store in `graphics/` directory

## Current Focus
The thesis content is complete in draft form. Current work involves:
- Refining arguments based on feedback
- Strengthening empirical grounding
- Improving accessibility of philosophical concepts
- Preparing for publication/defense

## Important Notes
- The thesis takes a phenomenological approach grounded in Husserl's Lebenswelt
- Arguments are designed to be near-term (5-10 years) and contingent
- Focus is on deployed, non-embodied AI systems
- Cultural specificity is acknowledged throughout
