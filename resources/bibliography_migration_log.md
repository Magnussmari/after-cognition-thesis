# Bibliography Migration to Zotero - Process Log

## Date: 2025-08-11

### Overview
Successfully migrated from `AC_references_final.bib` to the Zotero-connected `After cognition.bib` file.

### Process Steps

1. **Backup Creation**
   - Backed up `AC_references_final.bib` with timestamp
   - Backed up `_quarto.yml` with timestamp

2. **Key Format Conversion**
   - Identified that Zotero uses different citation key format
     - Zotero: `authorLastNameFullTitleWordsYear` (e.g., `alganInheritedTrustGrowth2010`)
     - Thesis: `authorlastnameyear[descriptor]` (e.g., `algan2010inherited`)
   - Created `convert_bib_keys.py` script to map and convert keys
   - Generated mapping file: `key_mapping.txt` with 140 entries

3. **Bibliography File Preparation**
   - Converted Zotero keys to match thesis format
   - Created `After_cognition_converted.bib` with converted keys
   - Merged missing entries from original file (39 total entries added)

4. **Configuration Update**
   - Updated `_quarto.yml` to use: `bibliography: resources/After_cognition_converted.bib`

### Files Created/Modified
- `After_cognition_converted.bib` - Main bibliography file (Zotero + missing entries)
- `key_mapping.txt` - Key conversion reference
- `convert_bib_keys.py` - Conversion script
- `merge_missing_entries.py` - Entry merging script
- `bibliography_migration_log.md` - This documentation

### Verification
- All citations now render without warnings
- Total entries: 179 (140 from Zotero + 39 from original)
- Successfully tested with `quarto render`

### Notes
- The Zotero file is maintained as `resources/After cognition.bib`
- Future updates should be made in Zotero, then re-run conversion process
- Some entries only existed in the original file (likely manual additions)
