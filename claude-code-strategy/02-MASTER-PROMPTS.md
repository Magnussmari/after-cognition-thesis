# Claude Code Master Prompts Strategy

## üéØ The Ultra-Minimal Prompt Philosophy

Based on best practices, we'll create **3-5 MEGA PROMPTS** that can run for hours autonomously. Each prompt is designed to trigger extended thinking mode and maximize Claude Code's capabilities.

## üìã The Master Prompts

### üöÄ PROMPT 1: Complete Infrastructure Setup (4-6 hours)
```
ultrathink hard and build the complete After Cognition thesis platform infrastructure end-to-end.

First, initialize with /init and understand the existing Quarto-based thesis structure. Read all files in supabase-thesis-plan/ to understand the complete architecture.

Then systematically:

PHASE 1 - MCP Server Creation:
- Build the complete supabase-thesis-mcp server with all tools from 01-SUPABASE-MCP-SERVER.md
- Test each tool thoroughly with mock data
- Create comprehensive error handling and logging
- Build automated tests for all MCP tools

PHASE 2 - Database Setup:
- Connect to Supabase using the MCP server
- Create all tables from 02-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md with proper indexes
- Set up Row Level Security policies
- Create database functions and triggers
- Test with sample data insertion and queries
- Verify search functionality works

PHASE 3 - Content Pipeline:
- Build the complete Quarto parser that handles all academic features
- Process the existing thesis content preserving all formatting
- Create the GitHub Actions workflow for automated sync
- Test the pipeline with actual thesis chapters
- Verify citations, cross-references, and figures are preserved

PHASE 4 - Initial Data Load:
- Parse all existing Quarto content
- Upload to Supabase maintaining structure
- Verify all chapters and sections are correctly stored
- Test search across all content
- Generate initial analytics

Create a comprehensive test suite that verifies everything works. Document all environment variables needed. 

Use auto-accept mode internally for file operations but think carefully about database operations. If you encounter any issues, debug systematically using console.log and error traces.

Commit your work with descriptive messages every major milestone.
```

### üèóÔ∏è PROMPT 2: Complete Frontend Application (6-8 hours)
```
ultrathink harder and build the complete Next.js frontend for the After Cognition thesis reader platform.

Read the requirements from:
- 05-FRONTEND-DESIGN.md for UI/UX specifications  
- 03-IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md for feature requirements
- The existing auth-wrapper.tsx and login components for authentication patterns

- Error boundaries and fallbacks
- Accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA)

PERFORMANCE:

## üéÆ Execution Strategy

### Optimal Claude Code Settings

```bash
# Launch Claude Code with maximum capabilities
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --mcp-debug

# For long-running operations
claude --max-tokens 200000 --timeout 3600

# Enable auto-accept for specific phases
# Shift+Tab to toggle through modes:
# - Normal mode (for initial planning)
# - Auto-accept edit (for implementation)
# - Plan mode (for complex features)
```

### Prompt Optimization Techniques

1. **Trigger Extended Thinking**:
   - Use "ultrathink" for maximum reasoning
   - Use "think harder" for complex problems
   - Use "think hard" for medium complexity
   - Use "think" for standard operations

2. **Context Management**:
   - Use `/init` at the start of each major phase
   - Use `/compact` between major sections
   - Use `/clear` when switching contexts completely

3. **File References**:
   - Use tab completion for file paths
   - Reference specific documentation files
   - Include mockups/screenshots when available

4. **Autonomous Execution**:
   - Enable auto-accept mode for repetitive tasks
   - Use plan mode for architectural decisions
   - Switch to normal mode for review points

### Session Management

```bash
# Create command shortcuts in .claude/commands/

# .claude/commands/build-thesis.md
Build the complete After Cognition thesis platform following the implementation plan in claude-code-strategy/.
Read all documentation files first, then execute Phase $ARGUMENTS.

# .claude/commands/test-all.md
Run comprehensive tests on the thesis platform including:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests  
- E2E tests
- Performance tests
- Accessibility tests
Report results with specific metrics.

# .claude/commands/deploy.md
Deploy the thesis platform to $ARGUMENTS environment.
Run pre-deployment checks, deploy, then run post-deployment verification.
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **MCP Connection Issues**:

   claude --mcp-debug
   # Check server logs
   # Verify environment variables
   ```

2. **Long-Running Operations**:
   ```bash
   # Use nohup for very long operations
   nohup claude -p "your prompt" > output.log 2>&1 &
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Use /compact more frequently
   # Clear unnecessary context
   # Break into smaller operations
   ```

4. **Database Conflicts**:
   ```bash
   # Use transactions
   # Implement proper rollback
   # Test on development branch first
   ```

## üéØ The Magic Formula

**Less Prompts + More Thinking + Full Autonomy = Maximum Impact**

By using these 4-5 mega prompts with Claude Code's maximum capabilities, you can build the entire thesis platform with minimal human intervention, letting Claude Code work for hours to deliver a production-ready system.

Remember: Trust the process, let Claude Code think deeply, and intervene only when absolutely necessary!
