# Quick Start Implementation Guide

## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

This guide gets you from zero to a working thesis platform in the shortest time possible using Claude Code's maximum capabilities.

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup (10 minutes)
```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Navigate to project
cd /Users/magnussmari/Documents/VALOR/Review_copies/After_cognition

# Create .env.local with your credentials
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
SUPABASE_URL=https://axjuevxjcestqhzdgjca.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://axjuevxjcestqhzdgjca.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
EOF

# Initialize Claude Code
claude --init
```

### 2. MCP Server Quick Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create MCP configuration
cat > .mcp.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--read-only",
        "--project-ref=axjuevxjcestqhzdgjca"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "get_from_supabase_dashboard"
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

### 3. Get Supabase Access Token
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Create a new access token
3. Add it to .mcp.json

## 🎯 The Power Launch Sequence

### Step 1: Launch Claude Code (30 seconds)
```bash
# Start with maximum power and auto-permissions
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Alternative: If you want more control
claude --mcp-debug
```

### Step 2: Initialize and Build MCP (Copy & Paste)
```
ultrathink and build a custom MCP server for our thesis platform.

Read the claude-code-strategy/01-SUPABASE-MCP-SERVER.md file completely.

Create a supabase-thesis-mcp directory with:
1. Complete TypeScript MCP server implementation
2. All tools from the specification 
3. Proper error handling and logging
4. Build and test the server
5. Update .mcp.json to use our custom server

Test that the MCP server connects properly and all tools are available.

Commit the MCP server code.
```

### Step 3: Database Setup (Copy & Paste)
```
think hard and set up the complete database infrastructure.

Read supabase-thesis-plan/02-DATABASE-SCHEMA.md for the complete schema.

Using our MCP server tools:
1. Create all tables with proper types and constraints
2. Set up all indexes for performance
3. Create all database functions and triggers
4. Set up Row Level Security policies
5. Configure full-text search
6. Create views for common queries

Test everything with sample data. Verify search works correctly.

Document any issues encountered and their solutions.
```

### Step 4: Content Pipeline (Copy & Paste)
```
think harder and build the complete content pipeline.

Read supabase-thesis-plan/04-CONTENT-PIPELINE.md for specifications.

Create:
1. QuartoParser class that processes HTML files
2. Content sync script that uploads to Supabase
3. GitHub Actions workflow for automation
4. Error handling and logging
5. Progress tracking for long operations

Parse and upload all existing thesis content from the parts/ directory.
Preserve all academic formatting, citations, and cross-references.

Verify all content is correctly stored and searchable.
```

### Step 5: Build Complete Frontend (Copy & Paste)
```
ultrathink harder and build the complete Next.js frontend application.

Read:
- supabase-thesis-plan/05-FRONTEND-DESIGN.md for UI specifications
- supabase-thesis-plan/03-IMPLEMENTATION-PHASES.md for features
- The existing auth components for authentication patterns

Build EVERYTHING:

CORE:
- Set up Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Implement authentication with existing Supabase auth
- Create all routes and layouts
- Build responsive navigation

READER:
- Table of contents with progress
- Chapter reader with smooth scrolling
- Section navigation
- Reading progress tracking
- Bookmarks and annotations
- Search with highlighting

UI/UX:
- Implement the complete design system
- Dark mode support
- Loading states and skeletons
- Error boundaries
- Mobile responsive with touch

FEATURES:
- Full-text search
- Reading analytics dashboard
- User settings
- Export functionality

Test everything thoroughly. Make it beautiful and fast.

Commit all code with descriptive messages.
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Production (Copy & Paste)
```
think and deploy everything to production.

1. Set up Vercel project
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy database migrations to production Supabase
4. Upload all content to production database
5. Deploy frontend to Vercel
6. Configure custom domain (if available)
7. Set up monitoring and analytics
8. Run production tests
9. Create deployment documentation

Provide all URLs and access information.

Verify everything works in production.
```

## ⚡ Speed Run Mode (1 Hour Total)

If you want to go REALLY fast, combine everything into one mega-prompt:

```
ultrathink harder and build the ENTIRE After Cognition thesis platform from scratch to production in one session.

Read ALL documentation in supabase-thesis-plan/ and claude-code-strategy/ first.

Then execute:

1. BUILD MCP SERVER (15 min)
   - Create custom MCP with all tools
   - Test connectivity
   
2. SETUP DATABASE (10 min)
   - Create all tables from schema
   - Configure search and security
   
3. LOAD CONTENT (10 min)
   - Parse all Quarto files
   - Upload to database
   
4. BUILD FRONTEND (20 min)
   - Complete Next.js app
   - All core features
   - Beautiful UI
   
5. DEPLOY (5 min)
   - Push to GitHub
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Go live

Work autonomously. Make decisions quickly. Focus on working features over perfection.

Use auto-accept mode for file operations. Test critical paths only.

Goal: Working thesis reader in production within 1 hour.

GO!
```

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Maximum Speed

### 1. Use Auto-Accept Mode
```bash
# Toggle with Shift+Tab to "auto-accept edit on"
# This skips all confirmation prompts
```

### 2. Parallel Sessions
```bash
# Run multiple Claude Code instances
# Terminal 1: Database setup
claude -p "Set up database schema"

# Terminal 2: Frontend build
claude -p "Build Next.js frontend"

# Terminal 3: Content processing
claude -p "Parse and upload content"
```

### 3. Skip Non-Essential Features
Focus on MVP first:
- ✅ Basic authentication
- ✅ Content display
- ✅ Navigation
- ✅ Search

Save for later:
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Collaboration features
- ❌ Complex animations

### 4. Use Existing Code
```
# Tell Claude to reuse existing components
"Adapt the existing auth-wrapper.tsx and login.tsx for authentication instead of building from scratch"
```

### 5. Leverage MCP Tools
```
# Once MCP is set up, use it for everything
"Use MCP tools to create tables instead of writing SQL manually"
"Use the sync_content tool to upload all chapters"
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

You'll know you're successful when:

**30 Minutes:**
- ✅ MCP server running
- ✅ Database tables created
- ✅ Some content uploaded

**1 Hour:**
- ✅ Basic frontend working
- ✅ Authentication functional
- ✅ Can read chapters

**2 Hours:**
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ Deployed to production
- ✅ Live and accessible

## 🚨 Emergency Fixes

### If Claude Code Freezes
```bash
# Kill and restart
Ctrl+C
claude --clear-cache
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### If Database Fails
```
"Debug database connection using MCP check_health tool"
"Show me the Supabase logs"
"Test with a simple query first"
```

### If Deploy Fails
```
"Check Vercel logs for errors"
"Verify all environment variables are set"
"Try deploying just the frontend first"
```

## 🎯 The ONE Command to Rule Them All

If you're feeling brave and want to see Claude Code's true power:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --max-tokens 200000

# Then paste:
"ultrathink harder and read everything in supabase-thesis-plan/ and claude-code-strategy/, then build and deploy the complete After Cognition thesis platform to production. Work autonomously for as long as needed. Make it excellent."
```

Then go have coffee. Come back to a deployed platform! ☕

## 📝 Final Notes

Remember:
- **Trust Claude Code** - It's smarter than you think
- **Use "ultrathink"** - Maximum reasoning power
- **Don't micromanage** - Let it work autonomously  
- **Commit often** - Easy rollback if needed
- **Test in production** - Move fast, fix later

The goal is a WORKING platform TODAY, not a perfect platform someday!

Good luck, and enjoy watching Claude Code build your entire thesis platform! 🚀
