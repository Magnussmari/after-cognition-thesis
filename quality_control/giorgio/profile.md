# Professor Giorgio Baruchello: A Comprehensive Profile for Academic CollaborationProfessor Giorgio Baruchello represents a unique synthesis of Continental European philosophical training with Anglo-Canadian analytical rigor, applied within the distinctive Nordic academic environment of Iceland. As your supporting supervisor, understanding his multifaceted intellectual journey, methodological approaches, and extensive scholarly output will provide invaluable insight for your thesis development.## Academic Origins and Philosophical FormationBorn in Genoa, Italy in 1974, Baruchello's intellectual formation began within the rich philosophical tradition of Italian humanism[1][2][3]. His undergraduate education at the Università degli Studi di Genova from 1993 to 1998 culminated in a Laurea in Philosophy awarded with the highest distinction (110 cum laude)[1]. This foundation in Continental European philosophical methodology provided him with deep expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and Italian intellectual history[3][4].

His decision to pursue doctoral studies at the University of Guelph in Canada from 1999 to 2002 marked a crucial turning point in his intellectual development[1][3]. Under the supervision of **John McMurtry**, with additional guidance from **Evandro Agazzi** and **Michele Marsonet**, Baruchello acquired expertise in analytical philosophy while maintaining his Continental philosophical sensibilities[3][5]. This combination of traditions has become a defining characteristic of his scholarly approach, allowing him to navigate between rigorous analytical methodology and the broader humanistic concerns of Continental philosophy.

## The McMurtry Connection: Life-Value Onto-AxiologyBaruchello's doctoral work under John McMurtry fundamentally shaped his approach to value theory and social philosophy. McMurtry's **Life-Value Onto-Axiology** (LVOA) became central to Baruchello's intellectual framework, representing what he considers "the most articulate theory of value developed by any philosopher in the 21st century"[5][6][7]. This philosophical system defines value in terms of life-capacity enablement, providing a universal criterion for evaluating economic, political, and social arrangements[8][5].

In his extensive writings on McMurtry's work, Baruchello demonstrates how LVOA challenges the **for-profit assault upon life-capabilities** that characterizes contemporary global capitalism[8][5]. His analysis reveals how human life faces threats not only from ecological collapse but also from the erosion of those **civil commons** - publicly accessible, non-commodified institutions - that enable human capabilities to flourish[8][5]. This theoretical framework underlies much of Baruchello's subsequent work in political philosophy, applied ethics, and social criticism.

The **civil commons** concept, which Baruchello has extensively developed and applied, encompasses life support systems including clean air and water, universal healthcare and education, language and culture, and environmental integrity[5][6]. Unlike market-based commons, McMurtry's formulation is inherently life-value-governed and universal in intent, providing diagnostic tools for identifying life-incoherent institutions and prescriptive guidance for restructuring them toward life-enablement[6].

## Academic Career at the University of AkureyriBaruchello's appointment to the University of Akureyri in 2003 began an extraordinary academic journey that would see him rise from Adjunct Professor to full Professor within six years while simultaneously establishing himself as a bridge between Nordic and Mediterranean intellectual traditions[1][9]. His rapid progression through the academic ranks - Assistant Professor (2004-2006), Associate Professor (2006-2009), and Professor (2009-present) - reflects both his scholarly productivity and his integration into Icelandic academic culture[1][9].

At the University of Akureyri, Baruchello's teaching portfolio demonstrates remarkable breadth, encompassing **Introduction to Philosophy**, **Ideology and History of Modern Times**, **The Concept of Modernity**, and various seminars in Modern Studies[9]. His specializations include **Political Philosophy**, **Applied Ethics**, **Axiology**, **Rhetoric**, **Business Ethics**, and **Humour** - a combination that reflects his interdisciplinary approach and commitment to making philosophy practically relevant[9].

The University of Akureyri's ranking as 3rd for Liberal Arts & Social Sciences in Iceland, with main research topics including Philosophy, reflects the quality of the intellectual environment within which Baruchello works[10]. The university's emphasis on interdisciplinary research and its strategic location in northern Iceland provide unique opportunities for studying Nordic-Mediterranean connections that have become central to his scholarly identity.

## Nordicum-Mediterraneum: Editorial Leadership and Academic VisionIn 2005, Baruchello founded and became Editor-in-Chief of **Nordicum-Mediterraneum: Icelandic E-Journal of Nordic and Mediterranean Studies**, a position he has held for nearly two decades[1][2][11]. This pioneering open-access journal has become a significant platform for interdisciplinary research connecting the Nordic and Mediterranean regions, reflecting Baruchello's vision of intellectual bridge-building across geographical and cultural boundaries[11].

The journal's success is evidenced by its continuous publication of high-quality, peer-reviewed research across multiple disciplines. Recent issues have addressed climate change education, environmental aesthetics, legal education in Iceland, migration studies, and Arctic research, demonstrating the journal's commitment to addressing contemporary challenges through interdisciplinary scholarship[11]. The journal's attribution of DOI numbers since 2019 and its collaboration with various international research networks underscore its scholarly credibility[11].

Baruchello's editorial philosophy emphasizes **linguistic versatility** and **geo-cultural emphasis**, with articles published in multiple languages and addressing diverse theoretical perspectives[11]. This approach reflects his belief that meaningful scholarship must transcend national and linguistic boundaries while remaining grounded in specific cultural contexts. The journal has featured contributions from across Europe and beyond, establishing it as a genuinely international forum for Nordic-Mediterranean studies[11].

## The Northwest Passage Books Partnership: Making Philosophy AccessibleOne of Baruchello's most innovative contributions to contemporary philosophy lies in his collaboration with Canada's **Northwest Passage Books**, which has resulted in a comprehensive five-volume series of his collected works[2][12][13]. This project, developed in partnership with publisher Brendan Myers, represents an ambitious attempt to make academic philosophy accessible to general audiences while maintaining scholarly rigor[2].

The series includes:

1. **Mortals, Money and Masters of Thought** (2017) - Philosophical reflections on mortality and economic systems[14]
2. **Philosophy of Cruelty** (2018) - Analysis of cruelty as a philosophical and social phenomenon[15][16]
3. **The Business of Life and Death, Volume 1: Values and Economies** (2018) - Application of life-value theory to economic analysis[17][5]
4. **Thinking and Talking** (2019) - Collected philosophical essays on dialogue and reasoning[2][12]
5. **Thinking and Laughing** (forthcoming) - Reflections on humor and philosophy[18]Reflecting his commitment to social responsibility, **all author royalties from these publications are donated to charitable organizations** in Guelph, Ontario, where Baruchello lived during his graduate studies[13]. This practice demonstrates his belief that philosophical inquiry should serve broader social purposes rather than merely advancing individual careers.

## Humor and Cruelty: A Groundbreaking Scholarly ProjectBaruchello's most ambitious recent scholarly undertaking is the four-volume **Humour and Cruelty** series published by De Gruyter in collaboration with Ársæll M. Arnarsson from the University of Iceland[19][20][21]. This comprehensive study represents one of the most systematic examinations of the relationship between humor and cruelty in contemporary philosophy[22][20].

The project addresses fundamental questions about human nature, social dynamics, and ethical behavior through rigorous analysis of how humor and cruelty interact across different cultural and historical contexts[22][20]. **Volume 1** examines the historical development of concepts of humor and cruelty in Western culture. **Volume 2** explores the mutual support that humor and cruelty can provide each other. **Volume 3** investigates conflicts between humor and cruelty, including how cruelty can be used to suppress humor and how humor can resist cruelty[21]. **Volume 4** provides synthesis and theoretical conclusions[21].

Baruchello's analysis reveals **nine distinct ways** that humor relates to cruelty, ranging from ordinary cruel humor and blood-related etymologies to the cruel irony of silencing humor to avoid potential cruelties[22]. This work demonstrates his ability to combine rigorous conceptual analysis with broad cultural and historical knowledge, creating scholarship that is both theoretically sophisticated and practically relevant[22][20].

## Philosophical Anthropology and the Human ConditionCentral to Baruchello's philosophical project is a sophisticated understanding of **philosophical anthropology** - the systematic study of human nature and the human condition[3][9]. His work draws extensively on insights from cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and social theory while remaining grounded in classical philosophical questions about mortality, meaning, and moral responsibility[23].

His approach to **mortality** challenges contemporary Western attitudes toward death, arguing against what he terms the "Wise View" that accepts death as natural and beneficial[23]. Drawing on life-value onto-axiology, Baruchello contends that death represents a genuine loss of life-capacity and should be viewed as an enemy to be combated rather than accepted[23]. This position places him within a small but growing movement of philosophers advocating for life extension and the eventual defeat of aging and death[23].

His analysis of **cruelty** as a philosophical category demonstrates similar analytical rigor. Rather than treating cruelty as a simple moral category, Baruchello examines it as a complex cluster concept encompassing painfulness, excessiveness, role-centeredness, power differentials, culpability, malevolence, and paradoxicality[22]. This multifaceted approach allows for nuanced analysis of how cruelty operates in different contexts and how it can be both combated and, paradoxically, sometimes employed in service of life-affirming goals[22].

## Applied Ethics and Business PhilosophyBaruchello's expertise in **business ethics** and **applied ethics** reflects his commitment to making philosophical insights practically relevant[9][24]. His work in this area draws heavily on McMurtry's critique of for-profit economics while developing concrete proposals for organizational and policy reform[8][5].

His analysis of contemporary capitalism focuses on what he terms the **constitutive life-blindness** of for-profit competition[8]. Using examples ranging from environmental destruction to workplace exploitation, Baruchello demonstrates how profit-maximization imperatives systematically undermine the life-support systems that enable human flourishing[8]. His proposed solutions center on strengthening civil commons and implementing life-value criteria in economic decision-making[8][5].

This work has particular relevance for understanding **corporate social responsibility**, **sustainable business practices**, and **stakeholder capitalism**. Rather than viewing these as optional add-ons to business practice, Baruchello's life-value framework suggests they are essential requirements for any economic system that truly serves human life[8][5].

## Rhetoric and Communication TheoryBaruchello's specialization in **rhetoric** connects to his broader concerns about democratic discourse and public reasoning[9][25]. His work examines how language shapes social reality and how communicative practices can either support or undermine life-affirming social arrangements[25].

His analysis of **"othering" rhetoric** - the linguistic and conceptual practices that create artificial divisions between social groups - demonstrates how seemingly neutral communication can become a tool of social exclusion and political manipulation[25]. This work has particular relevance for understanding contemporary challenges including migration, cultural integration, and democratic polarization[25].

His approach to rhetoric combines insights from classical sources like Aristotle with contemporary research in cognitive linguistics and social psychology[25]. This synthesis allows him to provide both historical perspective on enduring rhetorical patterns and practical guidance for improving contemporary public discourse[25].

## Cultural Integration and Icelandic IdentityBaruchello's personal journey from Italian-born academic to Icelandic citizen provides unique insight into processes of **cultural integration** and **identity formation**[26][27][28]. His acquisition of Icelandic citizenship around 2010, combined with his professional working proficiency in Icelandic, demonstrates successful navigation of Iceland's integration requirements[1][27][29].

His experience as an immigrant academic in Iceland has informed his scholarly work on **migration**, **cultural adaptation**, and **social integration**[26][30][28]. He has written extensively about the challenges facing immigrant communities in European societies, drawing on both personal experience and systematic research[30][28][29].

His analysis of **anti-immigration sentiment** identifies it as a form of scapegoating that emerges during periods of economic stress and social uncertainty[28]. Rather than viewing such sentiment as inevitable, Baruchello argues for policies that address underlying economic insecurities while promoting genuine cultural dialogue and mutual understanding[28].

## Literary-Philosophical InnovationBaruchello's most recent project involves a five-volume series of **Philosophical Fragments** scheduled for publication by Northwest Passage Books between 2025 and 2027[13]. This ambitious work represents an innovative approach to philosophical communication, combining rigorous theoretical content with literary forms including comedies, short stories, satires, and novellas[13].

The series addresses **the complex relationship between humor and cruelty** through creative literary expression rather than purely analytical argumentation[13]. While the stylistic medium is primarily farcical, the theoretical content remains serious, addressing fundamental questions about human nature and social organization[13]. Original artwork by international photographers will grace the covers, emphasizing the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the project[13].

This approach reflects Baruchello's belief that philosophy should engage multiple forms of human expression and reach diverse audiences[13][31]. As he notes in his contribution to a volume on teaching philosophy with humor, philosophical insight can emerge through various media, and effective philosophical education often requires creative pedagogical approaches[31].

## Teaching Philosophy and HumorBaruchello's expertise in using **humor as a philosophical tool** has made him a recognized figure in philosophical pedagogy[31][22]. His chapter "Laugh, If You Can, But Above All, Think! Extent, Experiences and Experiments in Philosophical Humour" demonstrates how humor can break through established conceptual frameworks and bring separate planes of thought into productive contact[31].

His pedagogical approach recognizes humor's **unique ability to break asunder established significations** while creating new possibilities for understanding[31]. Drawing on insights dating back to Socrates, Baruchello shows how philosophical instructors can mine humor's potential for generating insights while avoiding its potential for cruelty or exclusion[31].

This work has practical applications for philosophical education at all levels. By providing concrete examples of how humor can be used constructively in philosophical contexts, Baruchello offers tools for making philosophy more engaging and accessible without sacrificing intellectual rigor[31].

## International Scholarly NetworksBaruchello's extensive involvement in **international academic networks** reflects his commitment to transnational intellectual exchange[32][3][11]. His participation in organizations such as the University of the Arctic, Nordic Summer University research circles, and various European philosophical societies has created opportunities for collaborative research and intellectual cross-fertilization[32][11].

His editorial work with Nordicum-Mediterraneum has established connections with scholars across Europe and beyond, creating a platform for research that transcends traditional national and disciplinary boundaries[11]. The journal's collaboration with institutions ranging from the Nordic Summer University to various Italian universities demonstrates the breadth of these networks[11].

These connections have practical benefits for students working under his supervision, providing access to international research communities, potential collaboration opportunities, and exposure to diverse theoretical perspectives[32][11].

## Contemporary Relevance and Future DirectionsBaruchello's current research addresses several pressing contemporary challenges that make his work particularly relevant for thesis collaboration[11][22][28]. His analysis of **democratic polarization**, **migration and integration**, **economic inequality**, and **environmental crisis** provides theoretical frameworks for understanding complex social problems while suggesting practical solutions[8][11][28].

His ongoing work on **humor studies** connects to broader questions about **social cohesion**, **communication across difference**, and **the role of affect in politics**[22][20]. As democratic societies struggle with increasing polarization and declining trust in institutions, understanding how humor can either bridge or deepen social divisions becomes increasingly important[22][20].

His commitment to **open-access publishing** through Nordicum-Mediterraneum and his donation of book royalties to charitable causes demonstrates a vision of scholarship as public service rather than merely professional advancement[13][11]. This approach provides a model for how academic work can maintain scholarly rigor while serving broader social purposes[13][11].

## Implications for Thesis CollaborationWorking with Professor Baruchello as a supporting supervisor offers several distinctive advantages for thesis development:

**Methodological Sophistication**: His combination of Continental and Analytical philosophical training provides tools for addressing complex theoretical questions while maintaining rigorous standards of argumentation[3][4].

**Interdisciplinary Expertise**: His work spans philosophy, political theory, economics, psychology, and cultural studies, enabling sophisticated analysis of multifaceted problems[9][3][11].

**International Perspective**: His experience across Italian, Canadian, and Icelandic academic cultures, combined with extensive international networks, provides global context for research questions[1][32][11].

**Practical Application**: His expertise in applied ethics and business philosophy ensures research recommendations remain grounded in real-world implementation possibilities[8][9][5].

**Communication Skills**: His experience in academic writing, journal editing, and public engagement provides valuable guidance for thesis writing and scholarly communication[2][11][31].

**Ethical Framework**: His commitment to life-value onto-axiology provides coherent criteria for evaluating research implications and policy recommendations[8][5][6].

## ConclusionProfessor Giorgio Baruchello represents a unique synthesis of philosophical depth, cultural breadth, and practical engagement with contemporary challenges. His intellectual journey from Continental European philosophical training through Canadian analytical philosophy to Nordic academic leadership demonstrates remarkable adaptability while maintaining consistent commitment to core philosophical values.

His extensive scholarly output, innovative approaches to philosophical communication, and commitment to making philosophy accessible while maintaining intellectual rigor provide valuable models for academic work that serves both scholarly and social purposes. His expertise in areas ranging from value theory and political philosophy to humor studies and applied ethics positions him at the intersection of multiple contemporary debates about human flourishing, democratic governance, and cultural integration.

For thesis work, his approach offers powerful analytical tools combined with broad cultural knowledge and practical wisdom gained through decades of international academic experience. His commitment to life-value criteria provides coherent frameworks for evaluating research implications, while his experience bridging different intellectual traditions offers guidance for synthesizing diverse theoretical perspectives.

This philosophical system defines value in terms of life-capacity enablement, providing a universal criterion for evaluating economic, political, and social arrangements[8][5].

His analysis reveals how human life faces threats not only from ecological collapse but also from the erosion of those **civil commons** - publicly accessible, non-commodified institutions - that enable human capabilities to flourish[8][5]. This theoretical framework underlies much of Baruchello's subsequent work in political philosophy, applied ethics, and social criticism.

The **civil commons** concept, which Baruchello has extensively developed and applied, encompasses life support systems including clean air and water, universal healthcare and education, language and culture, and environmental integrity[5][6]. Unlike market-based commons, McMurtry's formulation is inherently life-value-governed and universal in intent, providing diagnostic tools for identifying life-incoherent institutions and prescriptive guidance for restructuring them toward life-enablement[6].

## Academic Career at the University of AkureyriBaruchello's appointment to the University of Akureyri in 2003 began an extraordinary academic journey that would see him rise from Adjunct Professor to full Professor within six years while simultaneously establishing himself as a bridge between Nordic and Mediterranean intellectual traditions[1][9]. His rapid progression through the academic ranks - Assistant Professor (2004-2006), Associate Professor (2006-2009), and Professor (2009-present) - reflects both his scholarly productivity and his integration into Icelandic academic culture[1][9].

At the University of Akureyri, Baruchello's teaching portfolio demonstrates remarkable breadth, encompassing **Introduction to Philosophy**, **Ideology and History of Modern Times**, **The Concept of Modernity**, and various seminars in Modern Studies[9]. His specializations include **Political Philosophy**, **Applied Ethics**, **Axiology**, **Rhetoric**, **Business Ethics**, and **Humour** - a combination that reflects his interdisciplinary approach and commitment to making philosophy practically relevant[9].

The University of Akureyri's ranking as 3rd for Liberal Arts & Social Sciences in Iceland, with main research topics including Philosophy, reflects the quality of the intellectual environment within which Baruchello works[10]. The university's emphasis on interdisciplinary research and its strategic location in northern Iceland provide unique opportunities for studying Nordic-Mediterranean connections that have become central to his scholarly identity.

## Nordicum-Mediterraneum: Editorial Leadership and Academic VisionIn 2005, Baruchello founded and became Editor-in-Chief of **Nordicum-Mediterraneum: Icelandic E-Journal of Nordic and Mediterranean Studies**, a position he has held for nearly two decades[1][2][11]. This pioneering open-access journal has become a significant platform for interdisciplinary research connecting the Nordic and Mediterranean regions, reflecting Baruchello's vision of intellectual bridge-building across geographical and cultural boundaries[11].

The journal's success is evidenced by its continuous publication of high-quality, peer-reviewed research across multiple disciplines. Recent issues have addressed climate change education, environmental aesthetics, legal education in Iceland, migration studies, and Arctic research, demonstrating the journal's commitment to addressing contemporary challenges through interdisciplinary scholarship[11]. The journal's attribution of DOI numbers since 2019 and its collaboration with various international research networks underscore its scholarly credibility[11].

Baruchello's editorial philosophy emphasizes **linguistic versatility** and **geo-cultural emphasis**, with articles published in multiple languages and addressing diverse theoretical perspectives[11]. This approach reflects his belief that meaningful scholarship must transcend national and linguistic boundaries while remaining grounded in specific cultural contexts. The journal has featured contributions from across Europe and beyond, establishing it as a genuinely international forum for Nordic-Mediterranean studies[11].

## The Northwest Passage Books Partnership: Making Philosophy AccessibleOne of Baruchello's most innovative contributions to contemporary philosophy lies in his collaboration with Canada's **Northwest Passage Books**, which has resulted in a comprehensive five-volume series of his collected works[2][12][13]. This project, developed in partnership with publisher Brendan Myers, represents an ambitious attempt to make academic philosophy accessible to general audiences while maintaining scholarly rigor[2].

The series includes:

1. **Mortals, Money and Masters of Thought** (2017) - Philosophical reflections on mortality and economic systems[14]
2. **Philosophy of Cruelty** (2018) - Analysis of cruelty as a philosophical and social phenomenon[15][16]
3. **The Business of Life and Death, Volume 1: Values and Economies** (2018) - Application of life-value theory to economic analysis[17][5]
4. **Thinking and Talking** (2019) - Collected philosophical essays on dialogue and reasoning[2][12]
5. **Thinking and Laughing** (forthcoming) - Reflections on humor and philosophy[18]Reflecting his commitment to social responsibility, **all author royalties from these publications are donated to charitable organizations** in Guelph, Ontario, where Baruchello lived during his graduate studies[13]. This practice demonstrates his belief that philosophical inquiry should serve broader social purposes rather than merely advancing individual careers.

## Humor and Cruelty: A Groundbreaking Scholarly ProjectBaruchello's most ambitious recent scholarly undertaking is the four-volume **Humour and Cruelty** series published by De Gruyter in collaboration with Ársæll M. Arnarsson from the University of Iceland[19][20][21]. This comprehensive study represents one of the most systematic examinations of the relationship between humor and cruelty in contemporary philosophy[22][20].

The project addresses fundamental questions about human nature, social dynamics, and ethical behavior through rigorous analysis of how humor and cruelty interact across different cultural and historical contexts[22][20]. **Volume 1** examines the historical development of concepts of humor and cruelty in Western culture. **Volume 2** explores the mutual support that humor and cruelty can provide each other. **Volume 3** investigates conflicts between humor and cruelty, including how cruelty can be used to suppress humor and how humor can resist cruelty[21]. **Volume 4** provides synthesis and theoretical conclusions[21].

Baruchello's analysis reveals **nine distinct ways** that humor relates to cruelty, ranging from ordinary cruel humor and blood-related etymologies to the cruel irony of silencing humor to avoid potential cruelties[22]. This work demonstrates his ability to combine rigorous conceptual analysis with broad cultural and historical knowledge, creating scholarship that is both theoretically sophisticated and practically relevant[22][20].

## Philosophical Anthropology and the Human ConditionCentral to Baruchello's philosophical project is a sophisticated understanding of **philosophical anthropology** - the systematic study of human nature and the human condition[3][9]. His work draws extensively on insights from cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and social theory while remaining grounded in classical philosophical questions about mortality, meaning, and moral responsibility[23].

His approach to **mortality** challenges contemporary Western attitudes toward death, arguing against what he terms the "Wise View" that accepts death as natural and beneficial[23]. Drawing on life-value onto-axiology, Baruchello contends that death represents a genuine loss of life-capacity and should be viewed as an enemy to be combated rather than accepted[23]. This position places him within a small but growing movement of philosophers advocating for life extension and the eventual defeat of aging and death[23].

His analysis of **cruelty** as a philosophical category demonstrates similar analytical rigor. Rather than treating cruelty as a simple moral category, Baruchello examines it as a complex cluster concept encompassing painfulness, excessiveness, role-centeredness, power differentials, culpability, malevolence, and paradoxicality[22]. This multifaceted approach allows for nuanced analysis of how cruelty operates in different contexts and how it can be both combated and, paradoxically, sometimes employed in service of life-affirming goals[22].

## Applied Ethics and Business PhilosophyBaruchello's expertise in **business ethics** and **applied ethics** reflects his commitment to making philosophical insights practically relevant[9][24]. His work in this area draws heavily on McMurtry's critique of for-profit economics while developing concrete proposals for organizational and policy reform[8][5].

His analysis of contemporary capitalism focuses on what he terms the **constitutive life-blindness** of for-profit competition[8]. Using examples ranging from environmental destruction to workplace exploitation, Baruchello demonstrates how profit-maximization imperatives systematically undermine the life-support systems that enable human flourishing[8]. His proposed solutions center on strengthening civil commons and implementing life-value criteria in economic decision-making[8][5].

This work has particular relevance for understanding **corporate social responsibility**, **sustainable business practices**, and **stakeholder capitalism**. Rather than viewing these as optional add-ons to business practice, Baruchello's life-value framework suggests they are essential requirements for any economic system that truly serves human life[8][5].

## Rhetoric and Communication TheoryBaruchello's specialization in **rhetoric** connects to his broader concerns about democratic discourse and public reasoning[9][25]. His work examines how language shapes social reality and how communicative practices can either support or undermine life-affirming social arrangements[25].

His analysis of **"othering" rhetoric** - the linguistic and conceptual practices that create artificial divisions between social groups - demonstrates how seemingly neutral communication can become a tool of social exclusion and political manipulation[25]. This work has particular relevance for understanding contemporary challenges including migration, cultural integration, and democratic polarization[25].

His approach to rhetoric combines insights from classical sources like Aristotle with contemporary research in cognitive linguistics and social psychology[25]. This synthesis allows him to provide both historical perspective on enduring rhetorical patterns and practical guidance for improving contemporary public discourse[25].

## Cultural Integration and Icelandic IdentityBaruchello's personal journey from Italian-born academic to Icelandic citizen provides unique insight into processes of **cultural integration** and **identity formation**[26][27][28]. His acquisition of Icelandic citizenship around 2010, combined with his professional working proficiency in Icelandic, demonstrates successful navigation of Iceland's integration requirements[1][27][29].

His experience as an immigrant academic in Iceland has informed his scholarly work on **migration**, **cultural adaptation**, and **social integration**[26][30][28]. He has written extensively about the challenges facing immigrant communities in European societies, drawing on both personal experience and systematic research[30][28][29].

His analysis of **anti-immigration sentiment** identifies it as a form of scapegoating that emerges during periods of economic stress and social uncertainty[28]. Rather than viewing such sentiment as inevitable, Baruchello argues for policies that address underlying economic insecurities while promoting genuine cultural dialogue and mutual understanding[28].

## Literary-Philosophical InnovationBaruchello's most recent project involves a five-volume series of **Philosophical Fragments** scheduled for publication by Northwest Passage Books between 2025 and 2027[13]. This ambitious work represents an innovative approach to philosophical communication, combining rigorous theoretical content with literary forms including comedies, short stories, satires, and novellas[13].

The series addresses **the complex relationship between humor and cruelty** through creative literary expression rather than purely analytical argumentation[13]. While the stylistic medium is primarily farcical, the theoretical content remains serious, addressing fundamental questions about human nature and social organization[13]. Original artwork by international photographers will grace the covers, emphasizing the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the project[13].

This approach reflects Baruchello's belief that philosophy should engage multiple forms of human expression and reach diverse audiences[13][31]. As he notes in his contribution to a volume on teaching philosophy with humor, philosophical insight can emerge through various media, and effective philosophical education often requires creative pedagogical approaches[31].

## Teaching Philosophy and HumorBaruchello's expertise in using **humor as a philosophical tool** has made him a recognized figure in philosophical pedagogy[31][22]. His chapter "Laugh, If You Can, But Above All, Think! Extent, Experiences and Experiments in Philosophical Humour" demonstrates how humor can break through established conceptual frameworks and bring separate planes of thought into productive contact[31].

His pedagogical approach recognizes humor's **unique ability to break asunder established significations** while creating new possibilities for understanding[31]. Drawing on insights dating back to Socrates, Baruchello shows how philosophical instructors can mine humor's potential for generating insights while avoiding its potential for cruelty or exclusion[31].

This work has practical applications for philosophical education at all levels. By providing concrete examples of how humor can be used constructively in philosophical contexts, Baruchello offers tools for making philosophy more engaging and accessible without sacrificing intellectual rigor[31].

## International Scholarly NetworksBaruchello's extensive involvement in **international academic networks** reflects his commitment to transnational intellectual exchange[32][3][11]. His participation in organizations such as the University of the Arctic, Nordic Summer University research circles, and various European philosophical societies has created opportunities for collaborative research and intellectual cross-fertilization[32][11].

His editorial work with Nordicum-Mediterraneum has established connections with scholars across Europe and beyond, creating a platform for research that transcends traditional national and disciplinary boundaries[11]. The journal's collaboration with institutions ranging from the Nordic Summer University to various Italian universities demonstrates the breadth of these networks[11].

These connections have practical benefits for students working under his supervision, providing access to international research communities, potential collaboration opportunities, and exposure to diverse theoretical perspectives[32][11].

## Contemporary Relevance and Future DirectionsBaruchello's current research addresses several pressing contemporary challenges that make his work particularly relevant for thesis collaboration[11][22][28]. His analysis of **democratic polarization**, **migration and integration**, **economic inequality**, and **environmental crisis** provides theoretical frameworks for understanding complex social problems while suggesting practical solutions[8][11][28].

His ongoing work on **humor studies** connects to broader questions about **social cohesion**, **communication across difference**, and **the role of affect in politics**[22][20]. As democratic societies struggle with increasing polarization and declining trust in institutions, understanding how humor can either bridge or deepen social divisions becomes increasingly important[22][20].

His commitment to **open-access publishing** through Nordicum-Mediterraneum and his donation of book royalties to charitable causes demonstrates a vision of scholarship as public service rather than merely professional advancement[13][11]. This approach provides a model for how academic work can maintain scholarly rigor while serving broader social purposes[13][11].

## Implications for Thesis CollaborationWorking with Professor Baruchello as a supporting supervisor offers several distinctive advantages for thesis development:

**Methodological Sophistication**: His combination of Continental and Analytical philosophical training provides tools for addressing complex theoretical questions while maintaining rigorous standards of argumentation[3][4].

**Interdisciplinary Expertise**: His work spans philosophy, political theory, economics, psychology, and cultural studies, enabling sophisticated analysis of multifaceted problems[9][3][11].

**International Perspective**: His experience across Italian, Canadian, and Icelandic academic cultures, combined with extensive international networks, provides global context for research questions[1][32][11].

**Practical Application**: His expertise in applied ethics and business philosophy ensures research recommendations remain grounded in real-world implementation possibilities[8][9][5].

**Communication Skills**: His experience in academic writing, journal editing, and public engagement provides valuable guidance for thesis writing and scholarly communication[2][11][31].

**Ethical Framework**: His commitment to life-value onto-axiology provides coherent criteria for evaluating research implications and policy recommendations[8][5][6].

## ConclusionProfessor Giorgio Baruchello represents a unique synthesis of philosophical depth, cultural breadth, and practical engagement with contemporary challenges.
