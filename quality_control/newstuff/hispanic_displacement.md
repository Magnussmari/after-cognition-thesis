The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on various racial and ethnic groups within the workforce, especially concerning displacement rates, reskilling success, and economic outcomes, has become a significant area of research since 2020. Studies indicate that certain groups, including Hispanic workers, face considerable job displacement risks due to AI and automation. Some estimates suggest a displacement risk of 25.5% for Hispanic workers, reflecting broader trends affecting vulnerable worker demographics.

Jetha et al. examine the effects of changing job landscapes on vulnerable workers, including Hispanic and Indigenous populations, noting that these groups often hold lower-skilled, entry-level positions that are more susceptible to automation. They emphasize that automation could worsen existing disparities and stress the urgent need for targeted reskilling initiatives to aid workers impacted by these changes (Jetha et al., 2020; Jetha et al., 2021). Adhikari and Hamal further support these findings, stating that sectors with low-skilled workers are likely to experience higher displacement risks with the advancement of AI technologies, thereby highlighting the importance of creating supportive environments for workforce retraining (Adhikari & Hamal, 2024; .

Evidence presented by Jetha et al. indicates that historically marginalized workers encounter systemic barriers when it comes to accessing reskilling programs. These barriers can limit their ability to transition to new job opportunities presented by AI advancements Jetha et al., 2021). Many Hispanic workers and other minority groups face challenges related to insufficient access to technology and educational resources, which hampers their potential for upward mobility and successful career transitions (Jetha et al., 2020; Jetha et al., 2021).

Regarding economic impacts, research demonstrates that Hispanic workers are disproportionately affected by job displacement due to automation, translating into severe economic strain for families that depend on these jobs (Adhikari & Hamal, 2024; -, 2024). Job loss, combined with inadequate reskilling efforts, can lead to increased economic insecurity within these communities, thereby necessitating interventions from policymakers to mitigate such disparities during the AI integration phase in labor markets (Annamalai & Vasunandan, 2024; Hatcher et al., 2020).

The ongoing health and socio-economic disparities have further exacerbated vulnerabilities faced by these communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies reveal that racial and ethnic inequities in health outcomes can lead to wider economic ramifications if not adequately addressed (Dyke et al., 2021; Javalkar et al., 2021; Qeadan et al., 2021). Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop frameworks that not only facilitate technological transitions but also consider the socio-economic challenges faced by the most affected groups.

In conclusion, the estimated 25.5% displacement rate for Hispanic workers illustrates a significant concern regarding AI's impact on the workforce. However, comprehensive research indicates that this situation is complex, intertwined with systemic inequalities, the need for resource allocation for reskilling, and broader socio-economic issues. Addressing these challenges necessitates a multi-faceted approach involving policy reforms, targeted educational initiatives, and community support systems.

Here, I present a list of relevant statistics regarding the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on different racial and ethnic groups in the workforce. The information specifically addresses displacement rates, reskilling success, and economic outcomes, particularly with respect to Hispanic workers who are often cited as facing a notable risk of job displacement.

Displacement Rates: Studies indicate that Hispanic workers face a significant risk of job displacement due to AI and automation. Research suggests that approximately 25% of Hispanic workers are at risk of job displacement, which is compounded by their representation in lower-skilled job sectors that are more vulnerable during transitions to automation (Liang, 2024). Moreover, jobs held by Hispanic workers, particularly in service-oriented or labor-intensive industries, are notably vulnerable to operational technology changes (Liang, 2024).

Reskilling Success: Evidence shows that systemic barriers hinder successful reskilling for Hispanic workers and other marginalized groups. Reports indicate that these groups face higher challenges accessing educational resources, which leads to lower participation rates in reskilling programs (Dyke et al., 2021). A review indicated that without targeted interventions to support vulnerable workers in transitioning to new job roles, the potentially positive impacts of AI could lead to increased socio-economic disparities (Harris et al., 2024). Only a lower percentage of displaced workers from minoritized backgrounds engage in reskilling compared to their white counterparts, posing significant scalability issues in workforce transitioning (Liang, 2024).

Economic Outcomes: The economic ramifications of AI-induced job displacement are pronounced among Hispanic workers. For instance, Liang's analysis suggests that job losses in industries such as manufacturing, where many Hispanic workers are employed, have resulted in increased poverty rates and economic insecurity (Liang, 2024). Recent findings indicate that Hispanic workers are overrepresented in "essential" jobs, which highlighted their job vulnerabilities during the pandemic, leading to financial instability as many lost employment or faced wage deductions (Rodríguez-Díaz et al., 2020).

Health and Mortality Disparities: The socioeconomic impacts of job displacement among Hispanic workers also correlate with health outcomes during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Research indicates that Hispanic populations experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infections and mortality rates, with access barriers to healthcare further exacerbating their economic challenges (Mackey et al., 2021). The disparities noted in hospitalizations and treatment access can be linked to the economic outcomes resulting from AI-induced job losses (Zhang & Kolady, 2022).

AI Bias Concerns: Alongside the risks of displacement and adverse economic outcomes, there are concerns about biases in AI that could disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities. Studies show that AI systems often perform significantly better for white individuals compared to Hispanics or other minorities, raising concerns about fairness in AI deployment (Daneshjou et al., 2021). This has the potential to exacerbate existing economic and social inequities as the labor market evolves with technological advances.

In conclusion, the data illustrates a complex intersection of risk concerning Hispanic workers in the workforce, revealing critical areas of concern about displacement, the efficacy of reskilling programs, and adverse economic outcomes exacerbated by underlying systemic inequalities reinforced by AI technologies.
