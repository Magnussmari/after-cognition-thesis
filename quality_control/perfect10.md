## 🔧 Claude Code Best Practices for Enhancement

### 1. **Systematic Analysis Pattern**
```python
# Pseudo-code for systematic enhancement
for chapter in thesis_chapters:
    empirical_claims = extract_claims(chapter)
    citation_strength = assess_citations(empirical_claims)
    gaps = identify_weak_support(citation_strength)
    research_queries = generate_queries(gaps)
    new_sources = search_literature(research_queries)
    integrate_sources(chapter, new_sources)
```

### 2. **Multi-Tool Coordination**
- Use Task tool for complex literature searches
- Employ concurrent file operations for speed
- Create structured data formats for analysis
- Build reusable search patterns

### 3. **Version Control Strategy**
```bash
# Create enhancement branches
git checkout -b empirical-enhancement
git checkout -b practical-toolkit
git checkout -b global-philosophy
```

### 4. **Quality Assurance Loop**
1. Identify claim
2. Search for evidence
3. Evaluate source quality
4. Integrate citation
5. Re-assess section score
6. Iterate until target reached

### 5. **Academic Best Practices with Claude Code**

#### Literature Review Optimization
```bash
# Create structured literature database
mkdir -p literature/{empirical,theoretical,methodological}
# Store search queries for reproducibility
echo "Search queries and results" > literature/search_log.md
```

**Best Practice**: Work on one section at a time, using Claude to track how key ideas evolve. Begin with foundational papers and use systematic search strategies.

#### Citation Management Workflow
```python
# Template for citation verification
for citation in chapter_citations:
    verify_source_exists()
    check_citation_format()
    ensure_primary_source()
    document_ai_assistance()
```

**Best Practice**: Always cross-check AI-generated citations with original sources. Document any AI assistance in methodology section.

#### Prompt Templates for Academic Tasks
Create reusable prompts in `.claude/commands/`:
```markdown
# literature_synthesis.md
Synthesize findings from these papers on [TOPIC]:
1. Identify key themes
2. Note methodological approaches
3. Highlight contradictions
4. Suggest research gaps
```

#### Section-by-Section Enhancement
**Best Practice**: Upload 2-3 examples of your best academic writing to maintain consistent style:
```
Prompt: "Analyze my writing style in these examples and apply it when enhancing the empirical evidence in Part I. Maintain academic rigor while improving clarity."
```

#### Interdisciplinary Integration
```
Prompt: "Find connections between phenomenology (Part II) and economic theory (Part III). Identify scholars who bridge these fields and suggest integration points."
```

### 6. **Quality Control Checklist**
- [ ] Every empirical claim linked to primary source
- [ ] AI contributions documented in methods
- [ ] Cross-verification completed for all data
- [ ] Writing style consistent throughout

### Final Note on Using AI Research Tools

When working with an AI that has access to peer-reviewed journals, structure your queries to:
- Specify date ranges (preferably 2020-2025 for currency)
- Request specific metrics (effect sizes, N, methodology)
- Ask for both supporting and contradicting evidence
- Require peer-reviewed sources only
- Request full citations in your preferred format

Remember: The goal is not just to find supporting evidence, but to build an empirically bulletproof foundation that anticipates and addresses all potential critiques.
