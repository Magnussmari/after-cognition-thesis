## üö® EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If Falling Behind Schedule:
1. **Priority Triage**: Focus on Phases 1-4 (foundation + evidence)
2. **Minimum Viable**: Neuroscience section + data integration essential
3. **Extension Options**: Phases 5-8 can extend into Week 5 if needed

### If Facing Resistance/Writer's Block:
1. **Return to Argument Arsenal**: Use power phrases as writing prompts
2. **Voice Reset**: Read existing paramedic vignettes to restore tone
3. **Empirical Anchor**: Use specific statistics to ground abstract arguments

### If Quality Concerns Arise:
1. **Daily Voice Check**: Does this sound like paramedic-father-philosopher?
2. **Citation Verification**: Every claim must have empirical backing
3. **Flow Assessment**: Does each addition serve existing narrative?
