## ‚öîÔ∏è COUNTER-ARGUMENTS TO ADDRESS

### Computational Consciousness Claims
**Dennett, D. C. (2017).** *From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds*. W. W. Norton.
- **Their Argument**: Consciousness is illusion, computation sufficient
- **Our Response**: Confuses function with experience; eliminativism fails phenomenology

**Putnam, H. (1975).** The meaning of 'meaning'. *Minnesota Studies in Philosophy of Science*, 7, 131-193.
- **Their Argument**: Functionalism - mental states are computational states
- **Our Response**: Multiple realizability doesn't address qualitative experience

### AI Consciousness Research
**Butlin, P., Long, R., Elmoznino, E., et al. (2023).** Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.08708.
- **Their Argument**: Computational architectures could achieve consciousness
- **Our Response**: Conflates information integration with experiential quality

**Reggia, J. A. (2013).** The rise of machine consciousness: Studying consciousness with computational models. *Neural Networks*, 44, 112-131.
- **Their Argument**: Computational models can study/achieve consciousness

## üéØ INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Opening Move: Acknowledge Strength
"Contemporary neuroscience offers sophisticated accounts of consciousness. Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Predictive Processing provide compelling frameworks for understanding neural mechanisms..."

### The Turn: Show the Gap
"Yet these frameworks describe the neural correlates of consciousness, not consciousness itself. The explanatory gap identified by Chalmers (1995) remains: no amount of functional description bridges to experiential reality..."

### The Clincher: Biological Necessity
"Three converging lines of neuroscientific evidence suggest consciousness requires not just complexity, but biological complexity: the substrate problem, the temporal existence problem, and the evolutionary embodiment problem..."
