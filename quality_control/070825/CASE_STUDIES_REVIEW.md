## üö® RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REPLACEMENT

### HIGH PRIORITY REPLACEMENTS:

1. **University Counseling Center Pilot** ‚Üí Replace with:
   - Woebot study (Fitzpatrick 2017) - actual AI therapy trial
   - UK NHS AI triage pilots with documented outcomes
   - Kaiser Permanente's AI-human mental health collaboration

2. **Helsinki Hospital Initiative** ‚Üí Consider replacing with:
   - Mayo Clinic's "Caring Deeply" program
   - Cleveland Clinic's caregiver experience initiatives
   - Documented mindfulness-based stress reduction in healthcare

3. **Detroit Auto Worker Reskilling** ‚Üí Could strengthen with:
   - German automotive industry's actual reskilling data
   - Swedish labor market transitions documentation
   - Danish flexicurity model outcomes

### KEEP AS IS:
- Hollywood Strikes (verified, powerful)
- Anti-Robot Violence (unique research)
- Smoke Break Ritual (memorable, democratic)
- Statistical Evidence (all properly cited)
- Market Concentration Data (economic proof)

### ENHANCE WITH SPECIFICS:
- Nordic Model (add program names, outcomes)
- Singapore SkillsFuture (add participation rates, results)

---

## üéØ STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Current Strengths:
- Mix of scales (individual ‚Üí organizational ‚Üí national)
- Balance of real events and illustrative examples
- Strong statistical backbone

### Current Weaknesses:
- Some cases appear hypothetical/illustrative
- Healthcare examples may lack documentation
- Worker transition stories need verification

### Replacement Strategy:
1. Prioritize documented, peer-reviewed cases
2. Maintain diversity of sectors (healthcare, labor, tech, education)
3. Keep memorable, democratizing examples (smoke break)
4. Add more international examples for global relevance
5. Ensure each case has verifiable outcomes/data

---

## üìã FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Cases to Definitely Keep**: 4, 5, 8, 10, 11  
**Cases Needing Replacement**: 3 (high priority), possibly 1 & 2  
**Cases to Enhance**: 6, 7, 9

The thesis would be strengthened by replacing hypothetical scenarios with documented case studies while maintaining the powerful mix of scales and sectors that make the argument accessible and compelling.
