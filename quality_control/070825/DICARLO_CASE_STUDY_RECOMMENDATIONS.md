# DiCarlo's Case Study Recommendations Analysis
## Strategic Replacement Options for "After Cognition"
### Date: August 6, 2025

---

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Dr. DiCarlo recommends replacing hypothetical case studies with one of three powerful, documented alternatives:
1. **AI Therapist (Woebot/Replika)** - Direct test of Cohesion & Meaning
2. **Hollywood Strikes** - Political economy validation  
3. **AI Tutor (Khanmigo)** - Educational development example

**Final Recommendation**: AI Therapist as the "purest test case" for irreducible human value

---

## ðŸ“Š CRITERIA FOR REPLACEMENT

DiCarlo establishes three essential criteria:
1. **Real and Documented** - Well-documented phenomena, not hypothetical
2. **Illustrative of Core Tension** - Highlights AI efficiency vs. irreducible human value
3. **Rich for Analysis** - Complex enough for ethical stress test and three-domain analysis

---

## ðŸ§  OPTION 1: AI THERAPIST (RECOMMENDED)

### Overview
Focus on AI-powered mental health chatbots (Woebot, Replika) that provide CBT, emotional support, and simulated companionship to millions.

### Strategic Value
- **Most direct test** of thesis claims
- Goes to heart of **Cohesion** and **Meaning** domains
- Mental health as intimate human service where "product" is relationship itself

### Monitor vs. Treater Model
**AI as Monitor:**
- Perfect CBT protocol delivery 24/7
- Infinite patience, no judgment
- Tracks mood, identifies cognitive distortions
- Provides exercises without fatigue

**Human as Treater:**
- **Presence**: Felt sense of conscious being holding space
- **Cohesion**: Relationship built on mutual vulnerability
- **Meaning**: Helps author new life narrative through lived wisdom

### Ethical Stress Test
**Consequences:**
- Long-term effects of attachments to non-sentient algorithms
- Risk when companies change algorithms or shut down
- Replika controversy as real-world example

**Deontology:**
- Company duties to vulnerable users
- Whether simulated relationships respect human dignity

**Virtues:**
- Resilience vs. dependency on simulated connections
- Impact on ability to form real human bonds

### Real-World Evidence
- **Woebot**: Recently shut down citing AI moving faster than regulators
- **Replika**: FTC complaints, sexual harassment issues, attachment controversies
- **Stanford study**: Found biases and harm risks in therapy chatbots

**DiCarlo's Verdict**: "Exceptionally strong choice... sharp focus on Cohesion and Meaning"

## ðŸŽ¬ OPTION 2: HOLLYWOOD STRIKES

### Overview
Analyze 2023 strikes by writers (WGA) and actors (SAG-AFTRA) with central demands for AI protections.

### Strategic Value
- Shifts focus to **creativity, labor, and political economy**
- Perfect example of "Politics of Cultivation" and "Institutional Judo"
- Documented defense of irreducible human authorship

### Three Domains Under Threat
**Meaning (Narrative Arc):**
- Writers argued story meaning comes from lived experience
- Direct defense of "self-authorship" principle

**Presence (Embodied Self):**
- Actors fought non-consensual digital doubles
- Defense of unique, embodied performance

**Cohesion (Intersubjective We):**
- Strike itself as collective effervescence
- Community defending shared values

### Political Economy Analysis
- Labor unions as defenders of post-industrial value
- Concrete pathway for resistance to "extractive domination"
- Template for other industries

### Real-World Outcomes
- WGA secured bans on AI scripts without credit
- SAG-AFTRA required consent for digital likenesses
- Agreements emphasized human authorship

**DiCarlo's Verdict**: "Powerful and politically astute... connects philosophical framework to real-world labor struggles"

## ðŸ“š OPTION 3: AI TUTOR

### Overview
Examine AI tutors in education (Khanmigo, Coursera's AI Coach) promising personalized learning and instant feedback.

### Strategic Value
- Universally relatable example
- Connects to "Developmental Caregiving" arguments
- Lower-stakes parallel to parenting/mentorship

### Instructor vs. Educator Model
**AI as Instructor:**
- Flawless curriculum delivery
- Adapts to student pace
- Infinite practice problems
- Ultimate information-transfer machine

**Human as Educator:**
- Inspires **awe** and curiosity
- Builds classroom **cohesion**
- Mentors through emotional challenges
- Models passion through embodied **presence**

### Ethical Considerations
**Consequences:**
- Effects on intrinsic motivation
- Two-tiered system (wealthy get humans, masses get AI)

**Virtues:**
- Intellectual curiosity vs. "gaming the algorithm"
- Deep learning vs. surface optimization

### Real Examples
- **Khanmigo**: Khan Academy's AI tutor with millions of users
- **Coursera Coach**: Integrated learning assistant

**DiCarlo's Verdict**: "Very strong and 'safe' choice... crystal-clear illustration in context everyone understands"

## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL RECOMMENDATION & STRATEGIC RATIONALE

### DiCarlo Strongly Recommends: **AI THERAPIST**

**Key Reasoning:**
1. **Most philosophically direct** challenge to thesis
2. Forces confrontation with whether **empathy, trust, vulnerability** can be simulated
3. **Purest test case** for Presence, Cohesion, and Meaning claims
4. Allows deployment of analytical frameworks with **maximum force**

### Implementation Strategy:
- Use AI Therapist as **main case study** in Part IV
- Reference Hollywood Strikes in **political strategy section** (5.7)
- Keep as proof-point for "Institutional Judo" concept

### Why This Choice Matters:
"It is the most philosophically and ethically direct challenge to your thesis... the purest test case for your claims about Presence, Cohesion, and Meaning."

---

## ðŸ“‹ VERIFICATION & AUTHENTICITY NOTES

### Message Authenticity:
- Style consistent with DiCarlo's expertise in AI ethics
- References align with his work on "Building a God" and AI governance
- No direct evidence this specific message was publicly shared
- May be synthesized advisory based on his known positions

### Factual Accuracy of Options:
All three options are **verified real phenomena**:
- âœ… AI therapists: Documented controversies and studies
- âœ… Hollywood strikes: Well-documented 2023 events
- âœ… AI tutors: Active platforms with millions of users

### Strategic Validity:
The analytical frameworks ("Monitor vs. Treater," ethical stress tests) are interpretive but align with established AI ethics discourse.

## ðŸš€ IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION

**Replace hypothetical University Counseling Center with AI Therapist case study**:
1. Use Woebot/Replika as concrete examples
2. Apply three-domain analysis as outlined
3. Include ethical stress test findings
4. Reference real controversies (Replika attachments, Woebot shutdown)
5. Connect to broader thesis arguments about irreducible human value

This replacement will:
- Strengthen empirical foundation
- Provide dramatic test of core claims
- Resonate with readers' concerns about AI intimacy
- Support both philosophical and political arguments
