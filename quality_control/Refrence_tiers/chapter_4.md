- Overcitation of case studies in one section.
- Under-citation of philosophical claims in methodology and synthesis sections.
- No page numbers for direct quotes (if any).

## ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

1. **Citation density per tier:**
   - Tier 1: 6/22 (27%)
   - Tier 2: 10/22 (45%)
   - Tier 3: 6/22 (27%)

2. **Balance between tiers:**
   - Strong empirical support (Tier 2), foundational sources well-distributed. Tier 3 is appropriately limited.

3. **Foundational sources distribution:**
   - Present in methodology, ethical analysis, and therapeutic context sections; well-integrated throughout.

4. **Empirical claims support:**
   - Most claims are well-supported, but some case study and ethical analysis assertions could use more direct citation.

5. **Sections under/over-cited:**
   - Case study and ethical analysis sections are heavily cited; methodology and synthesis sections could use more foundational references.
