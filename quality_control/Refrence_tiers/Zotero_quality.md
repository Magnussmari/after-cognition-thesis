- **High Quality (70-84)**: Reliable sources suitable for primary citations
- **Good Quality (55-69)**: Useful sources with some limitations
- **Acceptable (40-54)**: Use with caution, verify claims
- **Poor Quality (25-39)**: Only for context or opposing viewpoints
- **Unreliable (0-24)**: Avoid or use only to demonstrate poor arguments

## Zotero Implementation Strategy

### Tag System for Quick Assessment

Create these color-coded tags in Zotero:

#### Quality Level Tags
- ðŸŸ¢ `QA-Gold` (Green) - Score 85-100
- ðŸ”µ `QA-High` (Blue) - Score 70-84
- ðŸŸ¡ `QA-Good` (Yellow) - Score 55-69
- ðŸŸ  `QA-Fair` (Orange) - Score 40-54
- ðŸ”´ `QA-Poor` (Red) - Score 25-39
- âš« `QA-Unreliable` (Black) - Score 0-24

#### Assessment Status Tags
- `QA-Pending` - Needs quality assessment
- `QA-Complete` - Assessment finished
- `QA-Recheck` - Needs updated assessment

#### Special Concern Tags
- `Bias-Risk` - Potential conflict of interest
- `Outdated` - Needs newer source
- `Method-Weak` - Methodological concerns
- `Unverified` - Claims need verification
- `Retracted` - Paper has been retracted

### Quick Assessment Checklist

For efficient evaluation, use this rapid screening:

1. **30-Second Initial Screen**
   - Journal reputation (check Scimago or Impact Factor)
   - Author institutional affiliation
   - Publication year
   - Peer review status

2. **2-Minute Deep Check**
   - Scan methodology section
   - Check funding/conflicts statement
   - Review citation count (Google Scholar)
   - Assess sample size/design

3. **5-Minute Verification** (for key sources)
   - Verify author credentials
   - Check for retractions (Retraction Watch)
   - Cross-reference claims with other sources
   - Evaluate data availability

### Automated Quality Indicators

Add these to Zotero notes for each source:

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Immediate Disqualifiers
- Published in predatory journal (check Beall's List)
- Retracted paper (check Retraction Watch)
- No methodology section in empirical study
- Undisclosed major conflicts of interest
- Fabricated data or plagiarism

### Warning Signs
- Self-citations exceeding 20%
- No citations to opposing viewpoints

## Source Diversity Audit

Ensure your sources include:

- **Methodological diversity**: Quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods
- **Geographic diversity**: Not just Western/English sources
- **Temporal diversity**: Historical context and recent developments
- **Perspective diversity**: Different theoretical frameworks
- **Publication diversity**: Journals, books, reports, preprints

## Batch Processing Workflow

1. **Weekly Review Session**
   - Process 10-15 new sources
   - Apply quality tags
   - Add assessment notes

2. **Monthly Audit**
   - Review distribution of quality tags
   - Identify gaps needing better sources
   - Remove or replace poor quality sources

3. **Project-Specific Validation**
   - Before writing, filter by quality tags
   - Ensure key claims backed by Gold/High sources
   - Document quality decisions in research log
