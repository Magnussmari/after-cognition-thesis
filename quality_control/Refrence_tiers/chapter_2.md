## POTENTIAL ISSUES

- Some empirical claims (e.g., "clinical trials reveal a striking pattern") could use more direct citation.
- Echo chamber/polarization section is heavily cited; possible overcitation.
- Under-citation of philosophical claims in synthesis and counterargument sections.
- No page numbers for direct quotes (if any).
- Some global perspectives could use more non-Western sources.

## ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

1. **Citation density per tier:**
   - Tier 1: 10/38 (26%)
   - Tier 2: 19/38 (50%)
   - Tier 3: 9/38 (24%)

2. **Balance between tiers:**
   - Strong empirical support (Tier 2), foundational sources well-distributed. Tier 3 is appropriately limited.

3. **Foundational sources distribution:**
   - Present in theoretical, global, and narrative sections; well-integrated throughout.

4. **Empirical claims support:**
   - Most claims are well-supported, but some neuroscience and clinical trial assertions could use more direct citation.

5. **Sections under/over-cited:**
   - Echo chamber/polarization and workplace ritual sections are heavily cited; synthesis and counterargument sections could use more foundational references.
