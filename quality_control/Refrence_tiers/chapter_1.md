## POTENTIAL ISSUES

- Some empirical claims (e.g., “documented productivity gains”) could use more direct citation.
- Overcitation of displacement statistics in one section (pp.4–5).
- Under-citation of philosophical claims in “Beyond Price” section.
- No page numbers for direct quotes (if any).
- “COGSware” concept flagged as grey literature, not peer-reviewed.

## ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

1. **Citation density per tier:**
   - Tier 1: 7/34 (20%)
   - Tier 2: 18/34 (53%)
   - Tier 3: 9/34 (27%)

2. **Balance between tiers:**
   - Good empirical support (Tier 2), foundational sources present but could be more distributed. Tier 3 is appropriately limited.

3. **Foundational sources distribution:**
   - Present in core argument and theoretical sections, but less visible in later empirical sections.

4. **Empirical claims support:**
   - Most claims are well-supported, but some productivity and philosophical assertions could use more direct citation.

5. **Sections under/over-cited:**
   - Displacement/equity section (pp.4–5) is heavily cited; “Beyond Price” and philosophical sections could use more foundational references.
