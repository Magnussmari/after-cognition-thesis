## POTENTIAL ISSUES

- Some empirical claims (e.g., "shifting income shares toward H in roles with verifiable depth") could use more direct citation.
- Under-citation of technical modeling in A1 section.
- No page numbers for direct quotes (if any).

## ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

1. **Citation density per tier:**
   - Tier 1: 5/18 (28%)
   - Tier 2: 9/18 (50%)
   - Tier 3: 4/18 (22%)

2. **Balance between tiers:**
   - Strong support for foundational and empirical sources. Tier 3 is appropriately limited.

3. **Foundational sources distribution:**
   - Present in technical modeling, governance, and psychometric standards sections; well-integrated throughout.

4. **Empirical claims support:**
   - Most claims are well-supported, but some technical modeling and non-extractive models assertions could use more direct citation.

5. **Sections under/over-cited:**
   - Technical modeling and psychometric standards sections are heavily cited; non-extractive models section could use more foundational references.
