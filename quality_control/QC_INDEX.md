## üéØ Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Original Theoretical Framework**: Value Concentration Hypothesis offers novel contribution
2. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Successfully bridges philosophy, economics, and practice
3. **Social Justice Focus**: Addresses stratified impacts of AI automation
4. **Practical Orientation**: Provides concrete protocols and implementation strategies
5. **Methodological Innovation**: Paradoxical approach to studying AI limits

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Empirical Validation**: Many claims require systematic testing
2. **Cultural Expansion**: Framework remains Western-centric despite acknowledgments
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Protocols may be too complex for resource-constrained contexts
4. **Market Tensions**: Critique and use of market mechanisms not fully resolved
5. **Visual Elements**: Could benefit from additional figures and diagrams
