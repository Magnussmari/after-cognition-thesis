Build the complete MCP server for the After Cognition thesis platform.

Read claude-code-strategy/01-SUPABASE-MCP-SERVER.md for specifications.

Create a fully functional MCP server that provides tools for:
- Database operations (create tables, run queries)
- Content management (parse Quarto, sync content)
- User management (create users, track progress)
- Analytics (reading metrics, popular sections)
- Deployment (Vercel deployment, health checks)
- Search operations (setup indexes, full-text search)

Test each tool thoroughly. 

The server should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.
