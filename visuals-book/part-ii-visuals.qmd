# Part II: Lifeworld Cartography Visuals

This chapter contains the core visual framework of the thesis - the Three Domains of Irreducible Human Value.

## The Three Domains Framework

### Figure 2.1 — The Three Domains of Irreducible Human Value

*At the intersection of Presence (embodied self), Cohesion (intersubjective we), and Meaning (narrative arc) lies the irreducible core of human experience that remains beyond computational replication.*

This Venn diagram represents the thesis's central theoretical contribution. The overlapping areas indicate how these domains interpenetrate and reinforce each other in lived experience.

## Domains Summary Table

### Table 2.1 — Three Domains: Definitions, Indicators, Examples

::: {.tbl-colwidths="22,38,40"}
| **Domain** | **Operational Indicators (examples)** | **Everyday Examples** |
|---|---|---|
| Presence | Interoception (MAIA); sustained attention (MAAS/FFMQ); proprioceptive accuracy | Nurse sensing fever break; mechanic diagnosing by vibration; mindful walking |
| Cohesion | Trust scale change; rupture–repair latency; reciprocity index | Sweat-lodge/choral resonance; "smoke break" ritual; conflict repair |
| Meaning  | McAdams coherence; PTGI; purpose alignment | Reframing migration story; post-injury union safety leadership |

*Indicators are illustrative and would require full psychometric development before use.*

## Measurement Note
The operational indicators listed represent potential empirical approaches to validating these domains. Full psychometric development would be required before practical application.

## Cultural Variations in Domain Expression

While the three domains appear universal, their specific expressions vary across cultures:

- **Western emphasis**: Individual presence, dyadic trust, personal narrative
- **Ubuntu philosophy**: Collective presence, communal bonds, shared story
- **Buddhist traditions**: Non-self awareness, compassionate connection, liberation narrative
- **Indigenous worldviews**: Land-based presence, kinship networks, cyclical meaning

## Key Insights from Part II Visuals

1. **Interdependence**: The domains are not isolated capacities but mutually reinforcing aspects of human experience
2. **Measurability**: While irreducible to computation, these domains can be empirically validated
3. **Universality with Variation**: The framework captures human universals while allowing cultural specificity

This visual framework provides the theoretical foundation for understanding where human value concentrates as AI commoditizes cognitive tasks.
