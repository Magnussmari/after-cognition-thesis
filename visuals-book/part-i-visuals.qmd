# Part I: Economic and Existential Imperative Visuals

This chapter contains all tables and visual elements from Part I of the main manuscript.

## Economic Model Comparison

### Table 1.1 — Traditional SaaS vs AI/COGSware Economics

::: {.tbl-colwidths="24,38,38"}
| **Dimension**       | **Traditional SaaS**          | **AI/COGSware**         |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Cost Structure      | Fixed infrastructure         | Variable compute        |
| Gross Margins       | 80–90%                        | 50–70%                  |
| Pricing Model       | Per seat/month                | Per token/query         |
| Scaling             | **Near-zero marginal cost**   | **Linear compute costs**|

This table illustrates the shift from fixed-cost software to variable-cost AI computation with direct effects on margins and value capture.

## Stratified Reality of Displacement

### Table 1.2 — Stratified Displacement Snapshot (Illustrative)

::: {.tbl-colwidths="25,30,20,25"}
| **Group / Domain**    | **Indicator**                         | **Approx. Magnitude**   | **Source**                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Hispanic workers      | High-risk occupations overrepresentation | 22 of top 30           | [@baboolall2018automation]       |
| Hispanic workers (6 states) | High automation-risk workers         | 7.1 M (≈ 40% workforce) | [@dominguez2020latinos]          |
| Black workers         | Displacement rate (potential)         | ≈ 23.1%                 | [@cook2019future]                |
| White workers         | Displacement rate (potential)         | ≈ 22.4%                 | [@cook2019future]                |
| Surveillance bias     | Wrongful arrests via facial recognition | Predominantly Black men (cases) | [@aclu2024surveillance] |
| Reskilling barrier    | Lower retraining participation        | Qualitative disadvantage| [@nsc2023digital; @urban2023jobquality] |

*Illustrative, heterogeneous sources; magnitudes are not directly comparable across methodologies.*


::: {.callout-warning}
This data reveals how the commoditization crisis falls disproportionately on already marginalized communities. Any proposed solutions must address these disparities directly.

## Key Insights from Part I Visuals

1. **Economic Inversion**: The shift from fixed to variable costs fundamentally changes the economics of cognitive work
2. **Unequal Impact**: Automation displacement follows existing patterns of inequality
3. **Systemic Nature**: The crisis is not merely technological but deeply social and economic

These visuals establish the empirical foundation for the Value Concentration Hypothesis developed in subsequent parts.
