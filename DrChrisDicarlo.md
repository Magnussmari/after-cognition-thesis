# Dr. Christopher DiCarlo: A Comprehensive Profile for Academic Collaboration
Dr. Christopher DiCarlo stands as one of Canada's foremost philosopher-educators, with a distinguished career spanning critical thinking pedagogy, bioethics, cognitive evolution, and artificial intelligence governance. As your supporting supervisor, understanding his multifaceted academic journey, philosophical methodology, and current research focus will prove invaluable for your thesis work.
## Academic Foundation and Early Career
Dr. DiCarlo's intellectual journey began at the University of Waterloo, where he completed his PhD in Philosophy of Science and Ethics between 1990 and 1998[1][2]. During his doctoral studies, he worked alongside distinguished philosophers including Bill Abbot, Jim Van Evra, Rolf George, Jan Narveson, and Michael Ruse, establishing a foundation in rigorous philosophical analysis and ethical reasoning[2]. This diverse mentorship exposed him to various philosophical traditions, from formal logic to evolutionary ethics, shaping his interdisciplinary approach to complex problems.

His early career was marked by a prestigious appointment as Visiting Research Scholar at Harvard University from 1999 to 2002[1][2]. Within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, he conducted research at both the Department of Anthropology and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology[1]. This period proved transformative, as he developed research for two significant papers: "The Comparative Brain: The Evolution of Human Reasoning" and "The Evolution of Religion: Why Many Need to Believe in Deities, Demons, and the Unseen"[1][2]. During this time, he formed an important intellectual relationship with renowned biologist Edward O. Wilson, with whom he engaged in extensive discussions about evolutionary psychology and sociobiology[3].

## Critical Thinking Methodology: The ABCDEF Framework
DiCarlo has developed what is arguably one of the most accessible and comprehensive critical thinking frameworks in contemporary education. His **ABCDEF methodology** represents a systematic approach to analytical reasoning that has been adopted internationally[4][5][6]. The framework consists of:

**A - Argument Analysis**: Identifying the structure of claims, premises, and conclusions while recognizing that arguments themselves are neither inherently good nor bad, but rather reflect underlying biases and reasoning processes[6].

**B - Bias Recognition**: Understanding how biological and cultural filters - including family background, religion, education, media exposure, and social class - shape how individuals form and evaluate arguments[6].

**C - Context Evaluation**: Examining the circumstances, timing, and environmental factors that influence the meaning and validity of statements or positions[6].

**D - Diagram Construction**: Creating visual representations of arguments using house-like structures that clearly separate assumptions, premises, and conclusions[4][6].

**E - Evidence Assessment**: Systematically evaluating the quality, relevance, and sufficiency of supporting evidence for any given claim[4][6].

**F - Fallacy Detection**: Identifying common logical errors including ad hominem attacks, confirmation bias, false dichotomies, straw man arguments, and other reasoning failures[6][7].

This methodology goes beyond traditional logic courses by incorporating insights from cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology, and social science research. DiCarlo emphasizes that critical thinking is not merely an intellectual exercise but a practical skill set essential for democratic participation and personal decision-making[8][9].

## The Five-Step Ethical Framework
Complementing his critical thinking work, DiCarlo has developed a sophisticated **Five-Step Process for Assessing Ethical Dilemmas**[10]. This framework, which he employs in his role as Ethics Chair for the Canadian Mental Health Association, provides a structured approach to moral reasoning that incorporates multiple ethical traditions:

1. **Consequentialist Analysis**: Evaluating outcomes and their impacts on all stakeholders
2. **Deontological Assessment**: Examining duties, rights, and categorical imperatives
3. **Virtue Ethics Consideration**: Analyzing character traits and moral exemplars
4. **Contextual Evaluation**: Understanding cultural, social, and situational factors
5. **Consensus Building**: Facilitating dialogue among stakeholders to reach ethically informed decisions

This framework reflects DiCarlo's commitment to ethical pluralism and his belief that complex moral problems require multiple analytical perspectives[10].

## Publications and Literary Contributions
DiCarlo's written work demonstrates remarkable breadth and accessibility. His breakthrough book, **"How to Become a Really Good Pain in the Ass: A Critical Thinker's Guide to Asking the Right Questions"** (2011), became an international bestseller and is currently in its fifth printing[1][11].
The title, inspired by Socrates' description of himself as a "gadfly," reflects DiCarlo's conviction that effective critical thinking often requires challenging popular assumptions and asking uncomfortable questions[12].



His second major work, **"So You Think You Can Think? Tools for Having Intelligent Conversations and Getting Along"** (2020), was published by Rowman and Littlefield[1][8][13]. This book addresses the contemporary crisis of public discourse, providing practical tools for engaging in substantive dialogue across ideological divides[8]. The work emphasizes the distinction between facts and feelings while acknowledging the legitimate role of both in human decision-making[8].

Most significantly for contemporary discourse, DiCarlo's latest book **"Building a God: The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and the Race to Control It"** represents his entry into AI governance and ethics[14][15]. Published in 2025, this work addresses humanity's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI), arguing for proactive ethical frameworks and global governance structures[14][9].
## Teaching Philosophy and Educational Innovation
DiCarlo's pedagogical approach reflects deep engagement with Socratic methodology combined with contemporary insights from cognitive science. He employs what he terms a "pain in the ass" teaching style, deliberately challenging students' assumptions while maintaining respect for their dignity and intellectual potential[12]. His teaching methodology incorporates several key elements:

**Socratic Questioning**: Following the ancient philosopher's example, DiCarlo uses sustained questioning to help students discover inconsistencies in their reasoning and develop more sophisticated analytical skills[12][16].

**Real-World Application**: Rather than treating philosophy as abstract speculation, he consistently connects theoretical concepts to practical problems students face in their daily lives[17][4].

**Cross-Cultural Perspective**: Drawing from his research on cognitive evolution and human diversity, DiCarlo emphasizes universal reasoning principles while respecting cultural differences[18][19].

**Interactive Engagement**: His classes feature extensive discussion, collaborative problem-solving, and student-led inquiry rather than passive lecture consumption[17][4].

This approach has earned him multiple teaching awards, including TV Ontario's Big Ideas Best Lecturer in Ontario Award (2008), the Canadian Humanist of the Year Award (2008), and the UOIT Complementary Faculty Teaching Award (2008)[1][2][20].

## The "We Are All African" Controversy and Academic Freedom
A defining moment in DiCarlo's career occurred in 2005 when he wrote "We Are All African" on a blackboard during a critical thinking course at a Southern Ontario university[18][21][19]. This statement, based on genetic evidence from the Human Genome Project and National Geographic's Genographic Project, was intended to illustrate human unity and challenge racist assumptions[18][19].

The incident sparked significant controversy, with some interpreting his scientific statement as culturally insensitive[21][22]. Christian fundamentalist students filed formal complaints, and the university administration initially responded with disciplinary action[23]. However, DiCarlo's position was ultimately vindicated as the scientific accuracy of his statement became clear and academic freedom advocates rallied to his support[22][23].

This experience reinforced DiCarlo's commitment to evidence-based reasoning while teaching him valuable lessons about cultural sensitivity and the importance of contextualizing scientific information within broader social frameworks[18][19]. The controversy also demonstrated his willingness to defend difficult truths even when they challenge popular beliefs or create personal professional risk.

## Current Leadership in AI Ethics and Governance
DiCarlo's current role as Senior Researcher and Ethicist at Convergence Analysis represents the culmination of his career-long interest in applied ethics and technological governance[24][25][26]. Convergence Analysis, a UK-based think tank focusing on AI risk and governance, conducts strategic research on transformative artificial intelligence scenarios[25][26].

Within this organization, DiCarlo leads three interconnected programs:

**AI Clarity**: Developing sophisticated scenario models for potential AI development pathways, including both beneficial and catastrophic outcomes[27][25].

**AI Governance**: Creating concrete policy recommendations for national and international AI regulation, including proposals for global registry systems and enforcement mechanisms[25][28].

**AI Awareness**: Educating policymakers and the public about AI risks and opportunities through publications, conferences, and media engagement[25][29].

His governance work draws heavily on his philosophical training, particularly his expertise in ethical reasoning and critical analysis. DiCarlo advocates for creating international regulatory frameworks similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to oversee AI development[30][14][28]. He argues that without proactive governance, humanity risks creating artificial superintelligence systems that could pose existential threats to human civilization[14][9].

## Philosophical Approach and Worldview
DiCarlo's philosophical perspective combines several distinctive elements that reflect his interdisciplinary training and practical experience:

**Naturalistic Humanism**: Drawing from his research with Edward O. Wilson and his work with Humanist Canada, DiCarlo embraces a worldview grounded in scientific understanding while maintaining deep respect for human dignity and moral agency[2][3].

**Methodological Skepticism**: Following ancient skeptical traditions, particularly those of Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus, he maintains intellectual humility while insisting on rigorous evidence standards[12][31].

**Pragmatic Ethics**: Rather than advocating for single ethical theories, DiCarlo employs pluralistic approaches that draw from consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics depending on contextual requirements[3][10].

**Democratic Intellectualism**: He believes that philosophical tools should be accessible to all citizens, not confined to academic elites, and that democratic societies require widespread critical thinking skills to function effectively[8][9].

**Cautious Optimism**: While acknowledging serious risks from emerging technologies and social trends, DiCarlo maintains hope that human reasoning capacity can address contemporary challenges if properly cultivated and applied[14][9].

## Organizational Affiliations and Professional Networks

**All Thinks Considered Podcast**: His bi-weekly podcast provides a platform for engaging with diverse thought leaders on contemporary issues through critical thinking and ethical reasoning lenses[33][34].

## Educational System Impact and Curriculum Development
One of DiCarlo's most significant contributions involves developing the first pilot project in Canada to introduce universal critical thinking skills into Ontario's public high school curriculum[1][35]. Working with the Upper Grand District School Board, he created modular programs that could be integrated across different subjects rather than requiring separate courses[36].

This curriculum development reflects his belief that critical thinking should be treated as fundamental literacy, comparable to reading and writing in importance for democratic citizenship[9][36]. The program has since expanded internationally, with implementations in Guatemala, Rwanda, Uganda, and Ghana, demonstrating the universal applicability of his pedagogical approaches[37].

His work in educational reform emphasizes practical skill development over theoretical knowledge, focusing on tools students can immediately apply to evaluate information, make decisions, and engage in constructive dialogue[8][36].

## Research Contributions and Scholarly Impact
DiCarlo's research spans multiple domains, reflecting his interdisciplinary approach to philosophical problems:

**Cognitive Evolution**: His Harvard-based research examined how human reasoning capacities evolved and how they function across different cultural contexts[1][38].

**Bioethics**: He has published extensively on medical ethics, particularly focusing on end-of-life care, reproductive rights, and healthcare resource allocation[1][17].
