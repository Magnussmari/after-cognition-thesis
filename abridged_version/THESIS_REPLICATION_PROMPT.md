# Advanced Academic Thesis Generation Prompt: The "After Cognition" Architecture

## Context and Purpose

You are tasked with generating a comprehensive thesis outline following the precise intellectual architecture of "After Cognition: Human Value in the Age of Irreducibility." This prompt provides meticulous, chapter-by-chapter guidance for creating a thesis that combines personal urgency, philosophical rigor, empirical grounding, and practical application while maintaining an activist stance toward systemic change.

## Core Architectural Requirements

### 1. Fundamental Stance
The thesis must NOT be a neutral academic survey. It must:
- Diagnose a civilizational crisis with clinical precision
- Propose concrete interventions grounded in both theory and evidence  
- Maintain urgency while avoiding despair
- Bridge personal experience with universal phenomena
- Combine Continental philosophical depth with Anglo-analytical rigor

### 2. Three-Act Narrative Structure

**ACT I - DIAGNOSIS** (Prologue + Introduction + Part I)
- Personal entry point revealing universal crisis
- Theoretical framework establishing core concepts
- Empirical evidence of systemic failure

**ACT II - TREATMENT** (Parts II + III)  
- Phenomenological/philosophical mapping of solution space
- Economic/practical model for implementation
- Integration of existing fragments into coherent framework

**ACT III - PROGNOSIS** (Part IV + Conclusion + Epilogue)
- Methodological innovation (paradoxical/recursive approach)
- Political strategy for transformation
- Prophetic warning and hopeful vision

### 3. Essential Conceptual Elements

Your thesis MUST include ALL of the following:

**A. Central Metaphor/Paradox**
- Introduced in Introduction (like Midas Paradox)
- Captures the tragic irony of the crisis
- Returns throughout as unifying thread
- Resolves in conclusion with transformation image

**B. Core Dichotomy**
- Two opposing logics/systems (like Information Factories vs. Human Irreducibility)
- One represents the crisis, one the solution
- Creates clear analytical framework
- Avoids false balance - one is clearly life-destroying

**C. Historical Grounding**
- The current crisis accelerates a deeper historical problem
- Identify the "great decoupling" or fundamental break
- Show how your topic intensifies pre-existing pathology
- Prevents presenting crisis as merely contemporary

**D. Tripartite Solution Framework**
- Three interconnected domains/principles/capacities
- Emerges from phenomenological or systematic analysis
- Each domain gets detailed theoretical development
- Creates memorable model (like Presence/Cohesion/Meaning)

**E. The Paradoxical Method**
- Using the crisis to reveal its own limits
- Recursive/reflexive methodology
- Transforms apparent weakness into strength
- Named memorably (like Ástrós Paradox)

**F. Political Economy Critique**
- Explicit analysis of power structures
- Corporate capture and resource asymmetry
- Why purely technical solutions fail
- Necessity of collective action

**G. Foresight Scenario**
- A seductive dystopia (like "Benevolent Cage")
- Material problems solved, existential ones intensified
- Warning against partial solutions
- Motivates comprehensive approach

### 4. Evidence Requirements

Each chapter must integrate:
- **Quantitative Data**: Specific statistics with citations
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Case studies, examples, narratives
- **Theoretical Grounding**: Established frameworks, properly credited
- **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Non-Western perspectives where relevant

## Final Reminders

- This is not a template but an architecture
- Adapt to your specific topic while maintaining structural integrity
